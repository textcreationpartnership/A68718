            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O bee much in perſwading thoſe that be favorites of ſome great perſon, to uſe that intereſt for their beſt advantage, were an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour ſomewhat needleſſe, conſidering naturall ſelfe-love inclineth men in ſuch caſes to be ſenſible enough of their owne good. Yet ſo dull is our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of matters that are of an higher nature, that though wee have the eare of God alwayes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen unto us, and free acceſſe to the throne of grace through Chriſt who appeareth in heaven for us,
<pb facs="tcp:593:6"/> carrying our names in his breaſt, yet wee need ſtirring up, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove this bleſſed liberty, though the whole world be not worth this one prerogative, that wee can boldly call God Father. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of our carriage ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in part from Satans malice, who laboureth to keepe us in darkneſſe, that we beleeve not, or minde not our beſt priviledges: which if wee did, how glorious would our lives appeare? how comfortably and fruitfully ſhould we walke? what honour ſhould God have by us? what ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice from us? how ſhould wee overlooke all oppoſite power? But now by reaſon wee are prone to beleeve Satan, and the lyes of our owne heart, and ready to call truth it ſelfe into queſtion, as if theſe things were too good to be true, no marvell if we paſſe our dayes ſo deadly. For what uſe of an hidden and lockt up treaſure, if we uſe not this key of prayer to
<pb facs="tcp:593:6"/> fetch from thence for al our need? What benefit of all the precious promiſes made in Chriſt unto us, unleſſe wee alledge them unto God, and with a reverent bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe binde him with his owne word, which he can no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, then ceaſſe to be God? If we tooke theſe things to heart, God ſhould heare oftener from us, we would be more in heaven than we are, ſeeing wee ſhould bring as much grace and comfort from God as we could bring faith to graspe and carry away.</p>
            <p>Beſides this fore-mentioned mindleſneſſe of our priviledges, ſince the fall the ſoule naturally loveth to ſpend and ſcatter it ſelfe about theſe preſent ſenſible things, and cannot without ſome ſtrife gather it ſelfe together, and fixe upon heavenly things. Now this talking with God requireth an actuall bent of the minde, and carryeth up the whole ſoule into heaven, and exerciſeth as all the
<pb facs="tcp:593:7"/> parts, ſo all the graces of the ſoule, faith especially, prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing elſe but the flame of faith. And Satan knowing that when we ſend up our deſires to God, it is to fetch ſupply against him, troubleth the ſoule, weake of it ſelfe, with a world of diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Where he cannot corrupt the doctrine of prayer (as in Popery) with hereſies and ſuperſtitious follies, there he laboureth to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the exerciſe of it. Wherein we ſhould be ſo farre from being diſcouraged, that we ſhould rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rather that that muſt needs be an excellent dutie which is ſo irkeſome to the fleſh, and which the devill ſo eagerly ſets againſt. This ſhould incourage us to this exerciſe, wherein lyeth all our ſtrength, that if in ſpite of Satans annoyance and our owne indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, we will ſet upon this duty, we ſhall finde our ſelves by little and little more raiſed up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and our hearts more and
<pb facs="tcp:593:7"/> more enlarged, God rewarding the uſe of that little grace wee finde at the firſt, with increaſe of ſtrength and comfort. To him that hath (in the exerciſe of that he hath) ſhall be given more. We ſhould labour not to be ignorant of Satans enterpriſes, who beſides his diverting our mindes from prayer, and diſturbing us in it, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth by all meanes to draw us to ſome ſin, the conſcience where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will ſtop our mouthes, and ſtifle our prayers, and ſhake our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and eclipſe our comfort: which he oft aymeth more at then the ſinne it ſelfe unto which hee tempteth us. We ſhould labour therefore to preſerve our ſelves in ſuch a ſtate of ſoule, wherein we might have boldneſſe with God, and wherein this gainfull trading with him might not bee hindred.</p>
            <p>To paſſe over many other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the neglect of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and dealing with God by
<pb facs="tcp:593:8"/> prayer, we may well iudge, as one of the chiefe, a ſelfe-ſufficiencie whereby men dwell too much in themſelves. He that hath nothing at home will ſeeke abroad. The poore man (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſupplications. If wee were poore in ſpirit, and ſaw our owne emptineſſe, it would force us out of our ſelves. Alas what temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can we reſiſt, much leſſe overcome without freſh ſuccour? What croſſe can we endure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out impatiencie, if we have not new ſupport? What ſucceſſe can we looke for, yea in common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, without his bleſſing? What good can we do, nay thinke of, without new ſtrength? When we do any good by his power, do we not need pardon for the blemiſhes of our beſt performances? What good bleſſing can we enjoy, ſo as we defile not our ſelves in it, without a further bleſſing, giving us with the thing the holy uſe of it? Yet we ſee moſt men content to
<pb facs="tcp:593:8"/> receive bleſſings as they come from Gods generall providence, without regarding any ſanctified uſe by prayer, whereas holy men knowing that God will be ſought unto even for thoſe things of which hee hath given a promiſe,<note place="margin">Ezek 36.37.</note> in obedience to this his divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, deſire to receive all from him as a fruit of their prayers. And Gods manner is to keep ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny bleſſings from his children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they have begged them, as delighting to heare his children ſpeake. The conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of moveth thoſe that have neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt communion with God to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him in all their waies, depending on him for direction, ſtrength, ſucceſſe, whereupon he delighteth in ſhewing himſelfe more familiarly unto them in the ſweeteſt experiences of his love, guiding them by his counſell whileſt they abide here, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bringing them to glory.<note place="margin">Pſal. 37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>24</note> As other graces grow in thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:593:9"/> are in the ſtate of grace: ſo this spirit of prayer receiveth conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall increaſe upon more inward acquaintance with God, and their owne eſtates. Whence they can never be miſerable, having God to poure forth their spirits and eaſe their hearts unto, who cannot but regard the voyce of his owne Spirit in them. But of our ſelves, ſuch is our caſe, that God who knoweth us better than wee know our ſelves, ſaith, wee know not what or how to pray, <hi>Rom. 8.26.</hi> This language of <hi>Canaan</hi> is ſtrange unto us. Which our bleſſed Saviour in mercy conſidering, ſtirred up a deſire in his Diſciples to bee taught of him the Sonne, how to speake to the Father. Where thereupon hee teacheth them a forme, which for heavenly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of matter, and exactneſſe of order, ſheweth that it could come from no other Author.</p>
            <p>This holy pattern comprizing
<pb facs="tcp:593:9"/> ſo much in ſo little, all things to bee deſired, in ſix ſhort petitions, it is needfull for the guides of Gods people to lay open the riches of it to the view of thoſe that are leſſe exerciſed. An endevour which his excellent Majeſty thought not unbeſeeming the greatneſſe of a King. For the uſe of a ſet forme of prayer, and this in speciall, I will make no queſtion: yet in the uſe of this prayer, we may dwell more in the meditation and enforcing ſuch petitions as ſhall concern our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſions: For inſtance, if ever there were time of praying, <hi>Let thy kingdome come,</hi> let Chriſt ariſe and his enemies bee ſcattered, then certainly now is the time for us to aſcend up into heaven by our prayers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake Chriſt, that hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the winds and waves, and cauſe a calme: that hee would bee ſtrong for his Church, in
<pb facs="tcp:593:10"/> maintaining his owne cauſe. It is Gods manner before any great worke for his Church, to ſtirre up the spirits of his beloved ones to give him no reſt. How earneſt was <hi>Daniel</hi> with the Lord imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly before the delivery out of Babylon.<note place="margin">Dan. 9.</note> And undoubtedly if we joyne the forces of our prayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſet upon God with an holy violence, hee would ſet his power, his wiſdome, his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, on worke for the exalting of his Church, and ruine of the enemies of it. Now is the time for <hi>Moſes</hi> his hands to bee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held whileſt <hi>Amalech</hi> goeth down.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">As in the lives of David, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, Ezekia, Iehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat, &amp;c.</note>The prevayling power of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with God in times of danger, appeareth not only in the ſacred hiſtory of the Bible, but hath been recorded in all ages of the Church.<note place="margin">Euſeb. l. 5.

            <p>After in the good Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> his time, <hi>An.

            <p>But to speake ſomething of this Treatiſe of this godly and painefull Miniſter of Chriſt; which is written by him without affectation, as deſirous to cloath spirituall things with a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manner of writing, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and godly Reader ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſound, cleare, ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all handling of the greateſt points that naturally fall within the diſcourſe, and a more large and uſefull unfolding of many things, than in former Treatiſes.

            <p>Chriſts diligence in teaching his ſervants and familie this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie religious duty of praier: both at this time, of his owne accord, and at another time at the requeſt of one of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, is firſt to be obſerved.<note place="margin">Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11.1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>All the actions of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> are obſervable, and of excellent uſe; but onely ſome of them binde Chriſtians to imitation. That I may therefore cleere the foundation of the doctrine to be concluded from Chriſts pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe; let it be conſidered, that the actions of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were of different natures. He did ſome acts as he was <hi>God,</hi> and as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man;</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:593:16"/> as his miracles, and offering up of himſelfe a ſacrifice for ſinne, &amp;c. Theſe actions ſhould work in all men an holy <hi>admiration</hi> of him, and <hi>faith</hi> in him: but muſt not, nay cannot be imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">How far Chriſts example doth bind to imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>He did other actions as hee was man, ſome whereof were <hi>indifferent,</hi> being neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded nor forbidden: others were <hi>neceſſarie,</hi> being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Thoſe actions which he did which were indifferent, doe teach us Chriſtian libertie, ſhewing what we may do: but doe not lay a bond upon the conſcience to tye us to doe the ſame. <hi>Chriſt</hi> did ſometimes ſtand when he prayed, this was an indifferent action: hence we may conclude, that wee may ſtand when we pray: but yet cannot conclude that we muſt ſtand alwaies when we pray. And the like muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of all other indifferent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:593:16"/> actions of his, except ſome true cauſe come betweene, which to us, may take away the indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie; as commandment of the Magiſtrate, or offence of the godly, or ſtumbling blocke to the wicked, or the like.</p>
            <p>The <hi>neceſſary</hi> actions which he did, that came under ſome commandement, were either <hi>ceremoniall,</hi> which concerned him as he was a Iew, borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> or <hi>morall,</hi> which concerned him as hee was a man, made under, and ſubject to the morall Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> though not by nature, for ſo he is above all law; but by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſubjection, as, in our ſtead, to which alſo he was deſigned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ceremoniall</hi> actions which he did, are not to be followed, becauſe he did put an end unto them all,<note place="margin">Col. 2.14.</note> when he nayled them on the croſſe. The <hi>Morall</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, viz. ſuch as obedience to his Parents, and love to his

            <p>All his actions in this kinde are exemplary rules, and doe adde a double force to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, both ſhewing what ought to bee done, and what is poſſible to bee done: wherefore from his example of teaching his Diſciples, who were as his familie, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions both publikely and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, as hee had opportunity, I conclude:</p>

Alſo while the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie remaineth wicked, it is a daily vexation to a righteous ſoul to behold their ignorance, and to ſee their ungodly deeds.

            <p>Laſtly, parents and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours have advantage above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, by reaſon of their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticke authoritie, which will cauſe the inferiours either for feare or love to regard inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

In all theſe reſpects, hee that is willing to imitate <hi>Chriſt;</hi> may ſee, that if hee have people under his charge, he muſt teach them the needful points of religion, ſuch as prayer, and the reſt. I have beene large in the proofe of this doctrine, becauſe many will not be convinced, and few are ſo

But in all this what ſingular thing do ye? Do not the very Pagans and Infidels as much? Thou wilt feed and cloathe thy beaſt. If thou wilt teach them manners that they may not ſhame thee when they converſe with men, then teach them the manner of praying, and good behaviour towards God, that when they meet with him, and ſpeake to him

Is it not a ſhame to parents when the <hi>childe</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knoweth what, nor how to ſpeake unto <hi>God,</hi> either for them, or for himſelfe? Doth common reaſon teach thee to traine them up in ſome honeſt trade of life, that they may live like men in their age? Let grace then teach thee that there is an age wherein if in this life they bee not taught to live godly, they ſhall never ſhine like men and Angels; yea, like Chriſt, as all godly men ſhall in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heavens: but when they dye, and this age come upon them, they muſt live baſely and miſerably, even as the divels in hell fire for evermore.</p>

            <p>I come now to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond caſe, to ſhew what this preparation unto prayer is.</p>
            <p>This preparation is twofold:</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A twofold preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to prayer.</note>The one generall, to be made before hand, inabling and fitting a man to pray in an inſtant, whenſoever he ſhall be moved to pray.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:593:28"/>
            <p>The other preparation is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and to be made imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before prayer, that it may the better be performed.</p>
            <p>Vnto that generall prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is required that a man be indued with the ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be a beleever, that he know God in Chriſt, being converted, having repented,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> and is in that ſtate of grace, that he can call God Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Prou. 19<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>2 Ioh. 4.22.</note> he muſt be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with competent knowledge of thoſe things which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in an acceptable prayer. A Catalogue whereof here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. The diſcuſſing of all which, or of moſt of them, you ſhall finde ſcattered in this Tract, as the Text of the Lords Prayer doth miniſter occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2 In prayer, God is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the minde, as an
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:593:29"/> incomprehenſible Spirit, Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and Deity, therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of any Image; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving alſo to be omnipotent and gracious, able and willing to reward them that come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Prayer is to bee made to God in the name of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus our onely Mediatour and Advocate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The matter of all Petitions muſt be lawfull, according to Gods will, warranted by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, preſident, or promiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 A man muſt pray with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, he himſelf know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he doth aske.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Prayer muſt bee made with a ſincere and holy intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, intending it as an holy worſhip of God, as well as a meanes to procure good to a mans ſelfe from God.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Prayer muſt be made with a ſenſe of what we want, and with a ſenſible deſire of that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:593:29"/> which we pray for.</p>
            <p n="8">8 In prayer there muſt be a diligent and (in endeavour) a conſtant attention, firſt to God, keeping the heart lift up towards him; as alſo to the things uttered in prayer, that the minde be upon them: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that hee attend, and take heed to himſelfe, with what diſpoſition and affection he doe pray. He ſhould looke to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe that his ſpirits be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and his thoughts gathered in, and, as much as may bee, kept in from wandring and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction. This is to be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in prayer.</p>
            <p n="9">9 There muſt bee an holy earneſtneſſe and fervency, and importunateneſſe in prayer, more or leſſe, according as the matter of prayer doth more or leſſe concerne Gods glory, and mans good.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Prayer muſt bee made with holy devotion, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:593:30"/> adoration; expreſſed in humble and reverent geſtures, and carrying of the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the greatneſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of God to whom wee pray.</p>
            <p n="11">11 In prayer a man muſt propound a right end to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; namely, that hee may, of Gods free grace, obtaine the thing deſired, that therewith he might honour God, and doe him more ſervice; but not for vaine glory, to be ſeene of men, not for charmes, not that hee may have wherewithall to ſpend upon his luſts, nor yet to merit thereby; as Hypocrites, Wizards, prophane perſons, and ſome Papiſts doe.</p>
            <p n="12">12 Prayer muſt be void of ſuperſtition, whether in reſpect of place, or number, as in need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and vaine repetitions upon Beades, as Papiſts doe; or any other waies.</p>
            <p n="13">13 He that prayeth aright,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:593:30"/> muſt pray in faith, he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God doth heare him, and that for Chriſts ſake he wil grant him all the petitions which he hath thus endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make according to his will, waiting confidently untill God do fulfill them.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, unto petitions muſt be joyned praiſe and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
            <p>This generall preparation muſt be alwaies readie, through an habitual knowledge of thoſe things which are required in an acceptable prayer.</p>
            <p>A particular and immediate preparation is this. When a man intendeth to pray, he muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter himſelfe from all other buſineſſe and thoughts, that he may apply himſelfe to medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Wherein he entreth into conſideration of what he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about, what is required in prayer, how things ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and him, what his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:593:31"/> ſinnes are, that are then to bee repented, confeſſed, and prayed againſt, and how they are and may be aggravated, alſo what ſpeciall graces and good things he is now to pray for, what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to pray againſt; likewiſe he is to conſider what favours God hath ſhewed him, &amp; what good things he hath beſtowed upon him, for which he is to praiſe God, &amp; give him thanks; alſo hee muſt conſider the grounds and warrant which he hath to approach to the throne of grace in prayer. Theſe things proſecuted, and well digeſted, a man ſhall be much the fitter to pray.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">To what prayers particular preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note>Prayers are either continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or onely ejaculatory, uttered in a ſecret and ſudden lifting up of the deſire to God. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and ſpeciall preparation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth onely to continued prayer.</p>
            <p>A mans occaſions allow him
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:593:31"/> ſometimes more time, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſſe; and he is better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to meditation at one time then at another, he may accordingly be longer or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in preparation.</p>
            <p>But in every continued and ſet prayer there muſt be at leaſt this preparation. A man muſt take himſelfe off from all other buſineſſe, and thoughts, and in that inſtant conſider, and ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eye of his faith, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, holineſſe, all-ſufficiencie, and goodneſſe of God, and ſo (with an heart humble in the ſenſe of his owne unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but lift up to God in hope of his mercie) he is to powre out the deſires of his ſoule unto him in the name of Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, according unto the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of prayer before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>

            <p>Order and edification in the Church, requireth ſet formes of prayers and praiſes, to be uſed in publicke: as it hath beene the cuſtome of all eſtabliſhed true Churches, there being common ſinnes to be deprecated, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graces to bee prayed for, and common mercies to thank
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:593:49"/> God for. And in more private praier, the ignorance forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and baſhfulneſſe of ſome perſons before their family, or others, cauſeth that for a time it is needfull to uſe the helpe of a ſet form, which he may reade, or repeate, ſo that he joyne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and aſſent of heart thereto. Yet it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that Chriſtians muſt not alwayes be ſuch novices and weaklings in religion, to uſe ſet formes of prayer in private (which like crutches and blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſerve to initiate and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to them helpe, untill they have gotten ſtrength) as if they never intended to pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
            <p>But let this here be obſerved. It muſt not on the other ſide be held, that onely premeditated, ſtudied and ſet praiers are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. He is not meete for the place of a Miniſter, nor worthy the name of a ſtrong Chriſtian,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:593:50"/> that hath ſo tyed his devotion to a ſet forme, that he will not, or cannot vary his petitions for his people, or himſelfe, as parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular occaſions varie, and new neceſſities require. It is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that any prayer booke ſhould meet with all occaſions, either of prayer or thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which fall out daily. And conceived prayer is not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and imperfect, but, if it be pertinent, and in truth, God liketh it,<note place="margin">Exo 14.15.</note> though it had no ſet forme to bring it forth. Such were the prayers of <hi>Moſes</hi> at the Red-ſea,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1.13.</note> and of <hi>Hannah</hi> at the Tabernacle, their prayers were conceived, and brought forth without ſet forme or voice.</p>
            <p>I conclude this point there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, affirming that it is an error to hold ſet prayer to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and it is no leſſe error, to hold that no prayer but a ſet forme of prayer is lawfull.</p>

Firſt learne the plaine meaning of the words, and the ſenſe and meaning of Chriſt in them. Secondly, learne how this patterne may be applied.</p>
            <p>As for the firſt, becauſe ſuch exceeding brevity doth cauſe ſome obſcurity, the more paines muſt be taken, that by the light of other Scripture, and helpe of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:593:52"/> thoſe men which have faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly travelled in the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this prayer, the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may be found out. And untill you meete with better directions, uſe theſe following.</p>
            <p>Firſt, two things in generall, one contrary to the other, are to be underſtood in every peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, petition, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation, praying for ſome thing that is good, and praying againſt the contrary evill. And it is a ſure rule, that in the ſame petition where the good thing is deſired, the contrary evill is prayed againſt, as in the foure former petitions. Alſo where the evill prayed againſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the petition, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary good thing to be deſired, is to be underſtood in the ſame petition, as in the two laſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. As it is in the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, in the ſame comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement that any vice is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the contrary duty is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:593:52"/>
            <p>A ſecond rule is: If one kind or part of any thing be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any petition, all kindes and parts of the ſame thing are to be underſtood.</p>
            <p>A third rule is, where any one thing is prayed for in any peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the cauſes &amp; effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and whatſoever properly belongeth unto the ſaid thing, is underſtood to be prayed for in the ſame petition: except they fall out to bee the expreſſe ſubject of ſome other petition.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is how application of this prayer may be made, to the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of all other prayers by it: which that ye may do, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that this prayer directeth us unto three things obſeruable in all prayers. Firſt the perſon to whom onely we muſt pray, concerning whom this is the rule. That perſon onely who is God and Lord of heaven and earth, is to be prayed unto: thus
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:593:53"/> much you learne both in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, in the beginning, and in the forme of praiſe in the end of the Lords Prayer. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing to be obſerved, is, what wee muſt aske, the rule thereof is; whatſoever may lawfully be asked, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wreſting bee referred to one of the ſixe petitions. If they can referre their requeſt to any petition, they may be bold to make it. It ſhall bee needfull therefore, to obſerve the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars under every petition, both what is prayed for, and what is prayed againſt, the moſt whereof ſhall appeare in the handling of each ſeverall petition, to which I doe ſend you. And when you have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what you may lawfully pray, ye may be longer or ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in any one petition, as your preſent need, or the particular occaſion doth require: which libertie may bee obſerued in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:593:53"/> thoſe prayers of the Apoſtles which are recorded for our uſe in the holy Scriptures. The third thing to be obſerved, is, with what diſpoſition of heart and affection we muſt pray. Which is fully expreſſed and implyed in that word, <hi>Amen:</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that prayer bee made with underſtanding, in truth, in fervencie, and in faith, as will manifeſtly appeare, when wee come to treate of that word.</p>
            <p>Here yet ſome queſtion may be made touching the order here ſet down: whether it muſt be preciſely kept? I anſwer, in the generall, it muſt; that is, Gods glory muſt be firſt in our aime; but touching the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner of expreſſing it, that is left to the libertie of him that prayeth, whether hee begin with praiſe, or with confeſſion of ſinnes, and asking forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, thereby making way to the other petitions with more
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:593:54"/> confidence. There is no rule to be given hereof, becauſe we ſee the Apoſtles, after they were taught this forme, did take this libertie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi> Here begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the patterne of prayer, which becauſe Chriſt Ieſus our Lord gave it to his Diſciples, is therefore called the <hi>Lords Prayer.</hi> It conſiſteth of two parts:</p>
            <p>The firſt is an expreſſing of a mans deſire unto God.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is a manifeſtation of the aſſent, and right diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his heart in putting up the aforeſaid deſires, in the word <hi>Amen,</hi> which though it be but one word, yet is full of excellent matter.</p>
            <p>The firſt part doth branch it ſelfe into three members:</p>
            <p n="1">1 Invocation upon God. <hi>Our Father which art in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Petition. <hi>Hallowed by thy
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:593:54"/> Name. Thy kingdome come, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 A forme of praiſe and than<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, containing reaſons why the former petitions ſhould be made unto God. <hi>For thine is kingdome, power, and glory for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Invocation, or calling upon God is here taken in the proper and ſtricteſt ſenſe; not for the whole exerciſe of prayer, but for appellation, in which a man calleth upon him whom hee would have to heare him. This invocation conſiſteth of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of God, who onely is to be called upon in prayer. He is deſcribed by two arguments. Firſt by the relation that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and his elect in Chriſt: <hi>Our Father.</hi> Secondly, by a ſigne of his ſoveraigntie, and majeſtie, that is, by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven, which is the Court of his majeſtie, the place from whence hee ſheweth his infinite power, goodneſſe, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:593:55"/> glory: <hi>Which art in heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deſcription of God by theſe two arguments (the one arguing his graciouſneſſe and readineſſe of will, the other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing his greatneſſe &amp; fulneſſe of power to helpe all that come unto him) is placed of purpoſe in the very entrance into pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſtrengthen the petitioners faith, that hee need not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſay as he did, <hi>If thou wilt thou canſt helpe me.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat 8.2.</note> For he is his father, therefore will do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, in his holy wiſedome, he judgeth fit to be done. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need he ſay as that other, <hi>If thou canſt doe any thing, helpe us.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 9.22</note> For his God, and father in the heavens, is almighty, and <hi>can doe whatſoever he pleaſeth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 115.3.</note> 
               <hi>and would have to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This deſcription of God to whom prayer is made, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them that are to pray, conſiſteth of the appropriating poſſeſſive particle <hi>(Our)</hi> and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:593:55"/> of that gracious title of God, <hi>(Father.)</hi> In this one deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, two things are ſignified, both the condition of them that pray, and of him that is prayed unto.</p>
            <p>Theſe words as they looke toward the perſons who may pray, they intimate a double condition. Firſt, that they have a right and intereſt in God; they can call him theirs, for they are the children of God. Secondly, <hi>(Our)</hi> importeth that common intereſt and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in God, which the reſt of the faithfull have in him; from which there groweth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of one Chriſtian with another, ſo that they become brethren. Theſe two qualities therefore, faith in God, and love to our brethren, are here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in every one that is qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for prayer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(Our)</hi> is not onely here a note of the joyning together
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:593:56"/> of many in prayer, when one man is the mouth of the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this forme of words is to be uttered by one in the <hi>cloſet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6.6.</note> as well as by many in publike: but it noteth that relation and reſpect of God to them, which is common unto their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.<note place="margin">2 King. 19.19.</note> Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> uſeth it, ſaying: <hi>O Lord our God, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, &amp;c. Daniel</hi> praying alone,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.17.18.</note> faith, <hi>Now therefore O our God, heare the prayer of thy ſervant.</hi> Not but that when we would expreſſe our particular faith and dependance upon God,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.39 Ier. 3.19. 1 Cor. 4.18.</note> we may ſay, My Father, or My God. But our Saviour maketh choiſe of this forme of ſpeech, becauſe it is full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and is beſt agreeing to all ſorts of prayer, both in private, as well as publike. Thus we ſee, what this deſcription of God intimateth, as it looketh towards thoſe that pray. As it looketh towards him to whom
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:593:56"/> prayer is made, he is firſt called <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Father,</hi> ſpoken of God is a word of relation to Chriſt the ſecond perſon in Trinity,<note place="margin">Pſal 2.7. Ioh. 1.14.</note> and ſo is proper to the firſt perſon in Trinity: Secondly, in relation to the creature, in a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reſpect to all, as he is the Author of their being, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in nature; thus all<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 32.6.</note> three perſons are called Father. God is alſo a Father in a ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his elect in Chriſt, as he is the Author of their ſpirituall being and ſubſiſting in ſtate of grace,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Ioh. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </label> I doubt not but that the prayers of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men, when they are from the heart, may in ſome ſort be acceptable, ſo farre forth as thereby to obtaine many good things of God; as health, deliverance from evils threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or already afflicted, and ſuch like. For God that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:593:63"/> the Ravens when they cry, will much rather heare men when they cry, though they be not his children. But as the prayers of a true childe of God differeth from the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of him that is unregenerate, ſo is the acceptance with God alſo different.</p>
            <p>Their difference ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare thus.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Difference betweene the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the wicked, and godly, and of their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance.</note>Firſt, a true childe of God doth in prayer call God Father with faith and holy confidence, with the affections of a childe. For when hee asketh forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his ſinne, it is with griefe, that he hath by his ſinne offended his Father, and it is with an heartie purpoſe not to offend him againe. Alſo when he prayeth for health, liberty, grace, or for any other good thing, it is with a deſire that in the injoyment of them, he may the better pleaſe and honour his heavenly Father.</p>
            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:593:63"/>
            <p>But a wicked man calleth God Father onely for forme, and in preſumption; and hee doth not pray unto him with a childelike, but either with a ſervile affection, as a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor before a Iudge,<note place="margin">1 King. 21.27.</note> as <hi>Ahab</hi> did; or with a carnall affection in his deſire of the good gifts of God, and the good things of this life, that therewith he may (like thoſe reproved by Saint <hi>Iames</hi>) imploy them for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of ſome or other of his luſts.<note place="margin">Iam. 4.3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the childe of God prayeth chiefly and moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for ſpirituall things, as, for faith, for forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, for holineſſe, for Gods favour, and for thoſe things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Gods kingdome and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>But the unregenerate man prayeth chiefly and moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily for Corne and Wine, for temporall things, and it may
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:593:64"/> be for heaven and happineſſe, (with <hi>Balaam</hi>) in generall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes;<note place="margin">Numb. 23.10.</note> but not particularly and unfainedly for graces, whereby he may forſake his beloved ſin, and may live holily unto the end of his dayes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the prayers of the godly, when they are made in ſinceritie, are like all other their good workes, they have a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall goodneſſe in them, being the acts of the regenerate part through the ſpirit, and are performed to a ſupernaturall end.</p>
            <p>But the prayers of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, though in ſome things they are unfained, yet, at beſt they are but naturall deſires, not intended as a ſervice of God, but onely as a meanes to ſerve their own turnes in thoſe things which they know can be obtained by no other meanes.</p>
            <p>Now touching the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of prayers with God.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:593:64"/> Thoſe which his children make, though they be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much imperfection, yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be the prayers of men reconciled to God by Chriſt, and doe proceed from hearts purified by faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are put up in the name of Chriſt, they become acceptable through him, ſo farre as to procure, not onely temporall good things, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſuch as are ſpirituall and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.

            <p>As for the prayers of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, becauſe God, and his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of prayer is thereby in ſome part honoured, they are in ſome part accepted, ſo farre, that many times they procure temporall good things; but it is onely temporall good things,

            <p>It is true <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> was a very man in all things like to us (ſinne onely excepted) &amp; was crucified upon a material croſſe capable of portraiture; yet no image can ſet forth <hi>Chriſt</hi> as he is our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and as he is to be worſhipped; For an image can onely ſet forth his bodily ſhape, and his outward ſtate of

               <note place="margin">Eccl. 5.2.</note> The meaning is, bee not raſh and inconſiderate, but ponder as well your words, that you may know how to utter your minde to God, as to conſider the matter what to ſpeak unto him; namely, you muſt uſe ſuch words, and ſo many as may aptly and ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe your deſires to God, without ſuperfluity of ſpeech, and without needleſſe and heartleſſe repetitions, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary digreſſions.

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:593:100"/> Gods publique worſhip, was a publique place, though it were a chamber in a private mans houſe: for, for a long time Chriſtians had no other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">Tertul. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. cap <hi>39.</hi>
               </note> but common houſes. But when the Church was at peace, houſes were built of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and dedicated to God for his publique worſhip; which therefore both in borrowed, and in proper ſpeech, were well called Temples, houſes of God, or Churches. Places pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or private are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alike holy, and alike fit for prayer reſpectively; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the publique place for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and the private place for private prayer. For ſince the death of Chriſt, all religious difference of place is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And Gods preſence is not tied to one place more than to another. Yet becauſe Churches are ſet apart for Gods ſervice, in that reſpect
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:593:100"/> they are to bee had in ſpeciall eſteeme, and reverence, ſo as to be wel and ſufficiently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and repaired, and kept comely with all ſuch outward beautie and ornaments as are beſeeming the pure worſhip of God. Alſo they are to be reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto by all ſorts diligently, at times appointed, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke worſhip of God, where all are to behave themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently before the Lord; And (out of the caſe of neceſſitie) theſe Churches are to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed onely for religious uſes.</p>
            <p>Touching eſteeme of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, a meane muſt be kept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two extreames, wee muſt not prophane them, with Atheiſts, nor yet ſuperſtitiouſly idolize them, with the Papiſts.</p>
            <p>When men are not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily hindered, Churches are to be frequented; where publicke prayers may be beſt made, and are like to bee beſt heard, not
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:593:101"/> becauſe the place it ſelfe hath more holineſſe than any other; but becauſe God hath in ſpecial ſort placed his name in thoſe his holy ordinances which there are performed, and is there preſent,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.20.</note> according to his promiſe in ſpeciall ſort, all the while that the congregation and people of God, with whom we joyne in the Church, are in the act of performance thereof. The Apoſtle had the Church in ſuch eſteeme, that from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe thereof he endeavoureth to convince the Corinthians of the greater ſinne,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.22.</note> ſaying, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe ye the Church of God?</hi> but by Church he meaneth not the place of aſſembling, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation aſſembled. Alſo it is better to pray in the aſſembly of the Church, becauſe there we have the helpe of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and the examples of others devotions, beſides that there is an uniting of the deſires of

            <p>As for private prayer, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate places, not the publicke, are fitteſt for them.

We muſt not attribute like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe to our Churches (which are onely as the Iewes Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues) as the Iews did to the Sanctuarie, and Temple. For God had in them placed viſible repreſentations of his preſence, namely, the Arke and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory, or Mercie-ſeat, and had by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Exo. 10.24</note> that hee would bee preſent in everie place where he ſhould place his

And that place was ſo holy by reaſon of the Altar, Mercy-ſeat, and other things, which typifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt, that no ſacrifice was to be offered ordinarily but at the Temple. Wherefore it was a place not onely of publicke,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 7.15.16.</note> but alſo of private prayer, and that by particular inſtitution. Therefore thoſe which could not come to Ieruſalem were, when they prayed, to looke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Temple;<note place="margin">2 Chron. 6.38.</note> and thoſe that could come to the Temple were to look towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie in the <hi>Sanctum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum;</hi>

            <p>Thus much of the Invocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and calling upon him to whom onely prayer may bee made. The petitions follow.</p>
            <pb n="186" facs="tcp:593:109"/>
            <p>The petitions do contain the matter of all lawfull requeſts. They may be divided different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according unto ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent reſpects as may be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them. Firſt, if wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the number, there are ſixe diſtinct petitions, and no more. I confeſſe, Divines of good an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity have reckoned ſeven, making two of the laſt: others of no leſſe authority, have not regarded the number at all. Some of the ancient, and moſt of the orthodox later Writers have reckoned but ſix, and (as I thinke) upon good ground. All agree in the five firſt, all the queſtion is about the ſixth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee one or two. Now becauſe the ſubject of both ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences in that petition is all one, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſanctification; and the conjunction <hi>(but)</hi> knitteth, <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> and <hi>deliver us from evill,</hi> together into one ſentence, it is more
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:593:109"/> than probable, that is but one petition. But whether there be ſix or ſeven, it is no matter of our faith, and doth not deſerve any heat of diſputation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the controverſie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we reſpect the different perſons whom the matter of the petitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, they are thus divided: the three firſt concerne God only; for we ſay, <hi>Thy Name, thy king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, thy will, &amp;c.</hi> The three laſt concern man; for wee ſay, <hi>Our</hi> bread, <hi>our</hi> ſinnes, lead <hi>us</hi> not, deliver <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, if wee reſpect that which ought to bee the chiefe end of every mans deſire, and the meanes to compaſſe the ſaid end, they have this order, and are thus divided:<note place="margin">Summum bonum.</note> the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the deſire of the chiefe good, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the glory of Gods name in the firſt petition, <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy Name:</hi> the means whereby his Name is hallowed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:593:110"/> and glorified, are the matter of all the reſt, delivered in a moſt heavenly order.</p>
            <p>Gods Name cannot bee hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, if hee doe not make his holy Name known by erecting his kingdome: therefore <hi>the comming of his kingdome</hi> is the matter of the ſecond petition.</p>
            <p>And becauſe his kingdome is not made manifeſt, and his Name is not acknowledged to be holy, and glory is not given unto him untill his will bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly obeyed: therefore <hi>thy will be done,</hi> is the matter of the third petition.</p>
            <p>Now becauſe no man can do the will of God upon earth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God ſuſtain him on earth; therefore <hi>daily ſupport</hi> from God is prayed for, and is the matter of the fourth petition.</p>
            <p>And when a man hath all comfortable ſupplies for this naturall life, yet if he bee not in Gods favour, and be reconciled
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:593:110"/> unto God, he neither hath will nor power to glorifie God, nor can bee accepted in any thing he doth; therefore <hi>forgiveneſſe of ſinnes,</hi> and juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, is the matter of the fift petition.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, though a man have his ſinnes paſt pardoned, and he be juſtified, he cannot do Gods will, nor declare that the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is come to him, nor any way hallow his Name, if he have not grace and power againſt ſinne; therefore the <hi>ſanctification of the whole man</hi> is prayed for, which is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the laſt petition. This is the holy order and ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the petitions.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of propounding the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cauſe a different acception of them: ſome are <hi>petitions</hi> properly ſo called, when the good things asked are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the evill prayed againſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:593:111"/> is underſtood, as in the foure firſt petitions: ſome are <hi>depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> when the evill prayed againſt is expreſſed, and the good prayed for is underſtood, as in the two laſt petitions.</p>
            <p>The firſt petition is <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be thy Name:</hi> here it muſt bee conſidered what is meant by <hi>Name;</hi> the object of hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; then what <hi>hallow</hi> ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>(Name)</hi> hath reference to God, and it ſignifieth God himſelfe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the perſon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Alſo all ſuch names and titles of God, his attibutes, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ordinances, and all things which have any ſpeciall print of Gods holineſſe ſtamped upon them, are Gods name, becauſe by them he is knowne, as men are by their names. The word <hi>thy</hi> appropriateth the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>name</hi> unto him who is before named and deſcribed in the invocation, oppoſing and preferring <hi>Gods name</hi> to the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:593:111"/> name of man, or Angell, or of any other creature. To <hi>hallow</hi> is either to make a thing holy, which was common or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane; or to declare and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and uſe holily ſome thing which is holy already. <hi>Hallow</hi> muſt not bee taken in the firſt ſenſe, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to make a thing holy: for God and his Name, alwayes was, is, and for ever ſhall be of it ſelfe moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But to <hi>hallow,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 29.23.</note> here ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, thus much, to conceive and acknowledge with the heart, and to declare with the tongue and life, that <hi>God and his Name is holy,</hi> and to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected and uſed as moſt holy; in like ſenſe as <hi>Wiſdome is</hi> ſaid to bee <hi>juſtified of her children,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.19</note> that is, declared and reſpected as wiſdome ought to bee reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. For to hallow a thing is, to reſpect and uſe it according to the holineſſe thereof. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning Gods name is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:593:112"/> to the hallowing of it. The aime of our Saviour is, that <hi>God may</hi> bee ſet up in mens hearts, and may bee glorified and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in the world. For this cauſe hee maketh choice of the moſt apt word that could be invented: for <hi>hallowing</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to a conſideration of Gods holineſſe, which is the <hi>glory</hi> of all other his attributes, and includeth the cauſe why he ſhould be glorified; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a word of larger extent than <hi>magnified</hi> or <hi>glorified:</hi> for the one doth but point out the glory of his greatneſſe, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth not expreſſe the cauſe why hee ſhould bee glorified; both which <hi>hallowed</hi> doth. For holineſſe is that rectitude in God, and freedome from all impureneſſe, and from all ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of imperfection or ſinne, which is the excellency and perfection of all other things that are in God; and (to ſpeake
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:593:112"/> with holy reverence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty) the other attributes of God could not be commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in God, if they were not all infinitely holy; His ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be tyranny, his juſtice would bee cruelty, his mercy would be fooliſh pity, his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome would bee craft and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, if his greatneſſe, juſtice, mercy, and wiſdome were not infinitely holy. The like may be ſaid of his other attributes. For we ſee in creatures, (as in the Deuill and ſinfull men the more ſtrength, and wiſdome, and skill they have, the more miſchievous they be, becauſe they want holineſſe to uſe theſe gifts aright. Wherefore in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> we deſire that the excellency of his Godhead may be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as there is due cauſe: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they ſing in the Song of the Lambe,<note place="margin">Rev. 15.4.</note> 
               <hi>Who ſhall not feare hee, O Lord, and glorifie thy

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> If therefore any man ſeeke not to glorifie God, he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a moſt hainous ſinne, than which, no ſinne is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. For man, ſince <hi>Adams</hi> fall, is moſt prone to fall into it, aſcribing too little to God, whom he doth not ſee, ſetting up and magnifying the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:593:115"/> too much which he doth ſee.</p>
            <p>That this ſinne may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeare to the conſcience, it muſt be conſidered when and how God is diſhonoured.</p>
            <p>Gods Name is diſhonoured, when he is profeſſedly denyed to be God; this is profeſſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme: or when hee is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be God, yet is not eſteemed and glorified as God;<note place="margin">Rom. 1.21.</note> which diſeſteeme is then ſhewed, when that reſpect which is due unto his perſon and Name, is not given unto him. His perſon is diſhonoured, when what is due to him, is not given to him, or is given to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>Honour is denied him three wayes, in heart, word, deed, and converſation. Man diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth God in heart, firſt when he is ignorant, and doth not know him. Secondly, when he hath a meane opinion
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:593:116"/> of him, or hath erronious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of him, queſtioning his providence, power, wiſedome, or any of his attributes. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he is forgetfull of him. Fourthly, when he doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him: thus <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> diſhonoured God.<note place="margin">Num. 20.12.</note> Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he doth not love him. Sixtly, when he doth not feare him. Seventhly, when he doth not truſt in him. Eightly, when he is not zealous for him.</p>
            <p>Man diſhonoureth God in <hi>word:</hi> Firſt, when he ſpeaketh not of him to his praiſe, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing him. Secondly, when he ſpeaketh not for him when hee is diſhonored by others. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he never or ſeldome ſpeaketh to him in thankeſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Fourthly, when he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth againſt him.</p>
            <p>Man diſhonoureth GOD in <hi>deed,</hi> when though he profeſſe God in word, yet doth deny him by his evill deeds, as they
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:593:116"/> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23. of whom it is ſaid, they diſhonoured God; and as thoſe in <hi>Titus</hi> 1.16. which though they profeſſed the knowledge of God, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him in their workes. Thus God is diſhonoured, by not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving due honour unto him.</p>
            <p>Gods honour is given to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when men give divine worſhip to any perſon or thing but God; as to worſhip Saints or images: alſo when men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into too neer a league with idolaters,<note place="margin">Mal. 2.11.</note> as to marry with the daughters of a ſtrange god; or when men take divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as <hi>Herod</hi> did the peoples applauſe, ſaying,<note place="margin">Act. 12 22.</note> 
               <hi>The voyce of God, and not of man:</hi> this glory of divine worſhip, God wil not have given to any other.</p>
            <p>This taking to ones ſelfe, or giving to another the honour due to God, proceedeth from theſe evill cauſes, pride, ſelfe-love, too high admiration of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:593:117"/> the creature; from ignorance, and want of admiration of the Creator.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God is diſhonoured when due reſpect is not given to his Name, as to his titles, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, or to his word and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinances, <hi>Malach.</hi> 1.12. or to his Saints and children. For all theſe have a ſpeciall print of his holineſſe ſtamped on them: ſo that if all theſe, or any of theſe, be either ſet at naught, or lightly eſteemed, hee taketh himſelfe in them to be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. And, to ſhut up all in a word; all miſconceit or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent conceit of God, or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent carriage, whether by word or deed, either towards God,<note place="margin">Mal 1.12. Ezek. 22.26. Lev 19.12. Amos 2.7. Mal. 2.10.11.</note> or towards any thing that is holy; all abuſing or taking of Gods name in vaine, all acts of unholineſſe and diſobedience are a prophaning of the holy Name of God.</p>
            <p>Thus the conſcience of every
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:593:117"/> offender may take notice how he hath prophaned the holineſſe of the Lord, and hath diſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Name, whereas hee ought to haue hallowed it. But know, it is not ſafe for any to diſhonour God: for his owne children, when they have failed in this point of giving honour unto God, have received diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and diſgrace from him. He ſaith to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye beleeved mee not, to ſanctifie mee in the eyes of the children of Iſrael, therefore yee ſhall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them, Numb.</hi> 20.12.<note place="margin">Deut. 32.51. 1 Sam. 2.17.</note> The high Prieſthood was removed from the houſe of <hi>Eli,</hi> becauſe he did not honour God in reſtraining his ſons, which cauſed (through their prophaneneſſe) <hi>the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of God to bee abhorred:</hi> therefore did God judge his houſe, ſaying, <hi>They that deſpiſe me, ſhall bee lightly eſteemed,</hi>

How did God diſgrace proud <hi>Nabuchadnezzar,</hi> when vaine-gloriouſly hee vaunted, ſaying: Is not this great Babel, that I have built for the houſe of the kingdome, <hi>by the might of my power,</hi> and for the <hi>honour of my majeſtie?</hi> Here was no acknowledgement of Gods power, nor any thing done for the honour of Gods Majeſtie, therefore while the word was in the kings mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, ſaying, <hi>O king Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan 4.30.31.</note> 
               <hi>to thee it is ſpoken, the kingdome is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from thee.</hi> Which was fulfilled accordingly: for hee was ſent to graze with beaſts of the field ſeven yeares, untill he was made to know, <hi>that the moſt high God ruleth in the kingdome of men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 4.32.</note> But when God reſtored him to himſelfe, and to his kingdome, then he could give God the glorie of all

            <p>Theſe ſevere judgements of God, executed upon men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tooke glorie from God, or gave it not to him, doth plainly ſhew that he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry jealous of his name, and of his glory, and that he will not endure that <hi>his glory ſhould be given to another:</hi>

            <p>Let all men therefore take heed how they prophane it by any means.

Theſe do not hallow Gods Name.</p>
            <p>I deſire that all that reade or heare this, would examine themſelves by what hath beene ſaid: by which they may trie whether they hallow Gods Name, or diſhallow it. And if

               <p>This kingdome of Chriſt is an <hi>everlaſting kingdome,</hi>

For as <hi>God the Father</hi> could, and did give all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned authority and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> without any the leaſt diminution of the glorie and ſoveraigntie of the <hi>firſt perſon in Trinitie;</hi> ſo can and will <hi>God the Sonne</hi> deliver up the ſame government and kingdome againe to the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> without any the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of the glory and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie of the <hi>ſecond perſon in Trinitie;</hi> or without any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement or leſſening of the glorie of his humanitie. For God the Father ſo gave all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to the Sonne, that yet he retained it all to himſelfe as God, to whom kingdome and power is eſſentiall and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable For whatſoever the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath, that ſame wholly he giveth to the Sonne,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.17.19.20.26.</note> and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth that wholly to himſelf.
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:593:136"/> The Father was King ſtill and Lord of all notwithſtanding; the giving of all power to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> did not take off any power and authoritie from the <hi>Father;</hi> but did onely varie the manner of adminiſtration of one and the ſame authoritie. <hi>Chriſt</hi> before hee was deputed to this his office of abſolute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie over all as Mediatour, was equall to the <hi>Father,</hi> yet was not made above the <hi>Father</hi> by vertue of what was given him, for,<note place="margin">1.

By this it is plaine that Chriſt, in reſpect of his deitie, looſeth no authoritie by this deliverie up of the kingdome to the Father.</p>

                  </label> But how will it appeare that the humanity of Chriſt in ſtate of ſubjection, ſhall not be leſſe glorious than it was before in ſtate of dominion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> It ſhall appeare thus. Firſt, the humanitie of Chriſt was in the ſame ſubjection while it was in ſtate of dominion, as it ſhall bee when that dominion ſhall be rendred up, namely, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Father as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manhood;</hi> therefore the humanitie receiveth no diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement by this ſubjection more in this latter ſtate than in the former. He is ſaid in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtate to be ſubject, that is,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:593:137"/> 
                  <hi>onely ſubject,</hi> and <hi>not governing</hi> the world as before; then hee was ſubject in one reſpect, but, King and governor in another, which latter onely is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by reddition of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though <hi>Christ</hi> hath given up the kingdome no more to governe as <hi>God and man,</hi> as a Mediatour, yet as <hi>God</hi> he ſhall ſtill governe; &amp; though <hi>Christ as he is man,</hi> and as he is a part of his Church ſhall bee ſubject; yet the <hi>manhood of Christ</hi> ſhall ſtill <hi>ſubſist</hi> in the <hi>Godhead of the Sonne,</hi> and the fulneſſe of his Godhead ſhall for ever dwell in the manhood,<note place="margin">Col. 2.9.</note> by reaſon of the perſonall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in which reſpect, though the manhood ſhall not participate in the worke of governing, yet it ſhall participate in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorie thereof, becauſe the Godhead and the manhood make but one Perſon.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:593:138"/>
               <p>Thirdly, Chriſt as man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth the head of the whole Church which is his bodie, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing them in ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holines, and glory, through the immediate communion which by him they have with God, by reaſon of that ſpirituall and inſeparable union which they hold with him. And it can bee no abatement of glory or content to him, to give up ſuch a manner of government, which though it was honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet it was with a kinde of burthen and care; ſo long as he did not give it up, untill he had finiſhed all which belonged to that his Kingly Office in ſaving all his ſubjects, and deſtroying all his enemies; for, the honour and glory of that former go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is due unto him for ever. Moreover, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that as he is head of his Church, hee muſt needs have more glory and joy when that
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:593:138"/> all the members of his body ſhall be perfectly glorified,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.26.27.</note> than he could have, when in ſtate of his Mediatour-ſhip onely, ſome of his members were glorified, and they alſo then glorified but in part.</p>
               <p>A King's onely ſonne being imployed by vertue of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as his Viceroy to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due and regaine to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a rebellious kingdome, when he hath fully effected it, he is to deliver up that kingdome with his commiſſion; which when he hath done, it pleaſeth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eaſe him of further care, and to cauſe him all his life time to live in triumph, ſeating him next to himſelfe in his kingdome. This latter conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no leſſe honourable and glorious, but is much more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and joyous than the former. Like to this is the ſtate of Chriſt as man, after the delivering up of his kingdome, in the ſtate<pb n="246" facs="tcp:593:139"/> of glorious ſubjection.</p>
               <p>That which is deſired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Gods kingdome,</hi> is that it may <hi>come.</hi> To come, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is an action of ſuch creatures which have power of moving, whereby they, being abſent or farre off, doe approach, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come preſent. Here it is taken metaphorically, importing firſt a deſire of continuance and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of ſo much of the kingdome as is come already. Secondly, the comming and being of his kingdome, where it is not yet erected. Thirdly, the growth towards perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe things which are come in truth, but not in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of degrees. Fourthly, the conſummation and perfect comming of all things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the glory of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The laſt is, when as things concerning this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are come in their being, they may ſo farre as may bee
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:593:139"/> profitable to us, come to our knowledge:<note place="margin">Iob 26.14.</note> for without this comming alſo, wee cannot ſo well glorifie God, in hallowing his Name. Therefore it is, that every ſpeciall manifeſtation of Chriſts glory when it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to men, may bee called a comming of his kingdome. Thus Chriſt's revealing ſome glimpſe of his glory, is called the <hi>comming of the kingdome of God with power.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 9.12</note> Theſe ſenſes of this word <hi>come,</hi> are ſo ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and agreeing one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it comprehendeth them all. So that when we ſay, <hi>Thy kingdome come,</hi> it is as if we ſaid: <hi>O Lord, who art the onely Potentate and King of kings, declare &amp; make thy Name knowne to be holy, by ſhewing thy ſelfe to bee the abſolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne over all, by ſuſtaining, preſeruing, and diſpoſing of all things in the world, ſo as both thy glory may appeare, and as it

And grant that all thine ordinances and meanes of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; eſtabliſhing thine Elect, may be ſet up in their puritie and power, to the effectuall calling, ordering and perfecting of thy people, untill thou have glorified thy ſelfe in bringing them all to eternall glory.

               <p>The <hi>King</hi> of this kingdome of grace, (as at large is before ſhewed) is <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> God and man: for he ſaith, <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</hi> Matth. 28.18.

               <p>Now albeit the kingdome of <hi>God</hi> may be come in reſpect of the externall meanes thereof, yet if the internal means which is the holy Ghoſt, and the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall working thereof, be not come, neither can the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate with his ſword, nor the Miniſter with the word availe any thing to the converting of any one Chriſtian, or winning of one ſoule to this kingdome.</p>

They do herein ſhew themſelves to be moſt abhominable hypocrites, and mockers of God. When the unmercifull man ſhall ſay, Lord relieve the poore, but will not himſelfe give him any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, though he have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to give: when the envious ſhall ſay, Lord proſper them, yet fret at it when they do proſper: when the malicious ſhall ſay, Give health, and at the ſame time entertaine murtherous purpoſes againſt them: when the perſecutor ſhall ſay, Lord give them liberty, yet plot how to lay them up, and keepe them in durance: when the unjuſt man ſhall pray, Lord give them bread, houſe, and all other good meanes of life, yet at that time intendeth to ſteale their goods, or detaine wages and other

Therefore in harveſt theſe ſervants reap and carry into the barn more in one day than need bee ſpent in many daies: Yet their care is but for the preſent, though their providence be for time to come. So it is between the great Lord of all the earth and his ſervants, he appointeth every man his worke in a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling: a great part of his worke is to earne and gather in, ſuch things as may maintain him and his, that there may be meate in Gods familie for a mans ſelfe, and for his fellow ſervants, as God ſhall pleaſe to diſtribute. Here is labour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and laying up by the ſervant; but all is for the Lord his maſter. When much is thus
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:593:201"/> gathered into Gods barnes and ſtorehouſes (ſay they be mens owne houſes) yet this ſervant ſhould onely expect his dinner, and ſupper, and other mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance from his maſter for the preſent day: leaving the care of proviſion upon God: it is not meet he ſhould be his own car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.

<pb n="381" facs="tcp:593:206"/> a civill right.

                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> Hence it is that wicked men have not ſo good and ſo full a right to the good creatures of God, as true beleevers have; nor yet can have ſo comfortable and ſo ſanctified a uſe of them as the godly may have; they never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the good creatures of God, but hee hath to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, though not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes for the having; yet for

               <p>Now whatſoever is needfull in both theſe reſpects, is here meant. From this diſtinction of neceſſity, ariſeth a poſition, which will give light to this point in hand: namely, <hi>that is needfull, and may be prayed for by a man of one calling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which may not be deſired of ſome other man of another cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and condition,</hi> becauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective or conditionall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie followeth the calling and perſonall condition of men.

               <p>
                  <hi>Forgive.</hi> Forgiveneſſe is an act of grace, whereby a man is acquitted from the whole guilt, and is releaſed of all the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſinne, in ſuch ſort that <hi>nothing can be layed to his charge.</hi> In this act of forgiving,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.33.</note> alluſion is made unto the acts of creditors to their debtors,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:593:219"/> which ſtand bound to them in obligations to pay certaine ſummes of money, or upon not payment to forfeit a far greater ſumme. Now when the debter doth make this forfeit, and is no way able of himſelfe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it, if the creditor doth forbeare to ſue the debtor, and doth freely cancell the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and give to him an acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that debt, this act of his is, To forgive.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe reſembled by the act of a King and a judge to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch ſubjects as by tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the law, had forfeited their lives into the hands of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Now when the King of his meere grace doth remit the offence and puniſhment, this is to pardon and forgive. Such an act as this, is that of Gods forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a ſinner.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe forgiveneſſe of ſinnes is of the greateſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that can concerne man,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:593:219"/> and becauſe <hi>justification of a ſinner,</hi> and this act of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is much miſtaken, by ſome wilfully, by others ignorantly, I will endeavour, in opening the meaning of this word <hi>(for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give)</hi> as diſtinctly, and as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I can, to ſhew what our deſire extendeth unto, <hi>when we ſay, forgive,</hi> ſhewing</p>
               <p>Firſt, what things do neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily go before forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what it is to have them forgiven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, what are thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effects of forgiveneſſe, which are comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p>Before any man can have his ſinnes forgiven, two things are required.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> bee made unto the juſtice of <hi>God,</hi> who is the partie offended by Sinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that there bee a
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:593:220"/> qualification of the partie to be forgiven, <hi>by faith,</hi> whereby he doth apply to himſelfe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt which he hath in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction before mentioned.</p>
               <p>For, although <hi>Gods</hi> forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſins be in many things like mans forgiving of men their treſpaſſes; yet in this it differeth much. Man by a meere ſingle act of mercie forgiveth without ſatisfaction, elſe it were no forgiveneſſe: but in <hi>Gods</hi> forgiving there is an act of mercie, mixed with juſtice. For the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith, that <hi>without ſhedding of bloud,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> that is, without ſatisfaction, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for ſinne, <hi>there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not but that <hi>God</hi> by his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power and meere mercy could have forgiven mans ſinne without any ſatisfaction of his juſtice.<note place="margin">Exod. 34.6</note> For <hi>mercie</hi> is as naturall to <hi>God,</hi> as is <hi>juſtice,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> was in himſelfe free to either,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:593:220"/> being no more tyed by his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to puniſh ſinners, than by his mercie to forgive them. God doth nothing, out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, by any naturall neceſſitie, but doth all things freely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>good pleaſure of his will.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.9.</note> And if he had ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he might as well out of his meere mercie have pardoned a ſinner without any ſatisfaction, as to account the guilt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the puniſhment of mans ſinne upon another, upon Chriſt a ſuretie, in himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and to accept of that puniſhment for ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>But <hi>God,</hi> intending to bring more glorie to his holy Name, and to ſhew his more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant love unto man, in doing him a greater good, he did in his holy wiſdome make choice rather of ſaving man by a way of mercie tempered with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, whereby the glorie of more of his <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies</hi>

He doth not ſay,<note place="margin">Act. 5.32.32.</note> to give forgiveneſſe of ſinnes to the Iſraell of God, if they will beleeve and repent; but he ſaith abſolutely, <hi>to give repentance,</hi> that is, <hi>faith, and amendment of

So that if Chriſt dyed and roſe againe to give repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes, he dyed and roſe againe, and was exalted to give faith and forgiveneſſe of ſinnes.</p>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:593:226"/>
               <p>Faith (conſiderable in and about forgiveneſſe of ſinnes) is either primary, or ſecondary.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a beleeving in Chriſt, that through him our ſinnes may be forgiven, and that we through him may bee ſaved.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a beleeving that our ſinnes are forgiven, and that by Chriſt we ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a ſingle and direct act of the ſoule,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>receiving Chriſt, and relying upon Chriſt, and upon the promiſe of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſalvation by him;</hi> by vertue whereof a man is <hi>united to Chriſt,</hi> and is ingrafted into him, and <hi>before God is juſtified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is a reflect act of the ſoule whereby in a mans conſcience he hath ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe that he doth beleeve in Chriſt, and that God hath forgiven him his ſinnes, and hath juſtified him through
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:593:227"/> Chriſt, by which act God doth by his ſpirit ſpeake peace and comfort to a mans ſoule, which is not that faith whereby wee ſtand juſt before God, but that whereby we are aſſured our ſinnes are forgiven, and that we are in ſtate of grace through Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The primarie faith is that which is to bee chiefly prayed for, in the behalfe of our ſelves and others before converſion. The ſecondary faith is chiefly to be prayed for in the behalfe of our ſelves and others after we beleeve, and are in ſtate of grace and ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Chriſts righteouſneſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is juſtified before God, in that it was performed by Chriſt for man, unto God, is virtually, and in way of right, mans righteouſneſſe, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth actually beleeve, and that becauſe by the decree of God the Father, and in the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:593:227"/> purpoſe of Chriſt it was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for all that ſhould through him beleeve. But this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Chriſt is not accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a man, nor yet is his in poſſeſſion and uſe untill he doe indeede beleeve, (I ſpeake of men of yeeres) by that primary faith before ſpoken of; nor yet is Chriſts righteouſneſſe ours in any comfortable ſenſe of it to our ſelves, untill we beleeve by that ſecondary faith before mentioned.</p>
               <p>Now, ſecondly, I am to ſhew what it is to have ſinnes to be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Forgiveneſſe in proper ſpeech is an act of Gods mercy in not imputing or accounting to a man his ſinnes, and thereupon, in not puniſhing him for ſinne. Which act is called alſo in Scripture, a taking away ſinne. A covering of ſinne, a blotting out of ſinne, a caſting it behind his backe, and the like.</p>
               <pb n="422" facs="tcp:593:228"/>
               <p>To forgive ſinne, not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſinne, and to be juſtified and diſcharged from the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne is all one.<note place="margin">Act. 13 38.39.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Here the ſenſe of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſinne is to be inlarged, and taken ſynechdocically, for our whole juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; that is, not onely for freedome from guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſinne unto eternall death; but alſo for acceptation unto favour by the imputation of Chriſts righteouſneſſe unto eternall life.</p>
               <p>In this juſtification, theſe two things are to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Firſt, the very act of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of mans perſon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods not accounting him a ſinner. Secondly, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and manifeſtation thereof unto a mans ſelfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man hath aſſurance that his ſinnes are pardoned, and doth actually injoy the benefits that
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:593:228"/> follow forgiveneſſe. Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in both theſe reſpects are here meant. That this may bee fully and plainely underſtood, conſider the whole order of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification. It is firſt in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purpoſe of the Father, to forgive and juſtifie a ſinner; wherefore with the Sonne and holy Ghoſt he did fore-appoint him thereunto. Secondly, it is in the Sonne, who being God and man, did actually by his death and reſurrection purchaſe this forgiveneſſe. Thirdly, it is in the holy Ghoſt, who doth actually apply the grace and merit of Chriſt, and ſo maketh a ſinner capable of the favour and mercy of the Father, through the merit of the Son. When this application is made, Chriſt actually by way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, preſenteth the ſinner unto his Father, who thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth actually receive him into favour. Now, after this
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:593:229"/> act of acceptance of a man into favour is paſſed with GOD, through Chriſt, then the holy Ghoſt doth make application of it unto the conſcience of him that is accepted.</p>
               <p>In the juſtification of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, there is a bleſſed concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſpeciall acts of the three Perſons in the bleſſed Trinity. God the Sonne having made ſatisfaction, doth alſo make interceſſion for him; God the Father having imputed his ſinnes to his ſurety Chriſt, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to account them unto him, and, accounting Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to him, hee accepteth of him as moſt righteous. The holy Ghoſt having made an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable union betweene Chriſt and the ſinner, he doth ſeale and ratifie this his juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation unto him.</p>
               <p>It muſt be diligently obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that though juſtification be but one individuall act in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:593:229"/> of the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> &amp; <hi>holy Ghoſt,</hi> in the firſt act of Faith, and converſion of a ſinner, whereby the perſon of a man ſtands juſtified before <hi>God,</hi> and ſhall, without <hi>interciſion of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification</hi> and loſſe of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, ſtand before the barre of Gods tribunall, and is, and alwaies ſhall be abſolutely juſtified and acquitted from all ſinnes paſt, preſent &amp; to come, becauſe all obligations &amp; hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writings againſt him, are in that act cancelled and blotted out: <hi>he forgiving all treſpaſſes, Coloſ.</hi> 2.13.14. Yet it muſt be knowne, that of this act there is (as it were) a double ſentence: Firſt, in Court of heaven, at which time the <hi>elect in Chriſt</hi> have their names inrolled <hi>in the booke of Gods effectuall calling,</hi> and are numbred among the juſt, which ſentence can never be revoked or blotted out: this is that which was paſſed with
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:593:230"/> 
                  <hi>God</hi> (that I may ſo ſpeake, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of men) in the firſt act of converſion. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this ſentence of forgiveneſſe is paſſed <hi>in the court of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi> of him that had the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſentence pronounced for him in heaven. This ſentence is the ſecond act of the holy Ghoſt, wrought in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Firſt, after that a ſinner is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>vinced of his guiltines of ſin, and of his damnable condition becauſe of his ſinne, then <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe</hi> is offered, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the eare in that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe of ſalvation <hi>to all that beleeve in Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> which promiſe is proclaimed in the miniſterie of the Goſpell, in which light of the Goſpell, he ſheweth unto a man poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſalvation, ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him (I ſpeake of men of yeeres and underſtanding) Chriſt the meanes of ſalvation; and by this meanes the holy
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:593:230"/> Ghoſt worketh faith in Chriſt; then confeſſion and griefe for ſinne; then prayer to aske for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe; and grace to live godly, and then doth witneſſe to his ſpirit that he is accepted of God. Thus ſentence is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the conſcience: from whence ariſeth ſenſe of Gods love, which is called the <hi>ſhedding abroad of the love of God in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 5.5. alſo ſenſe of the <hi>loving countenance</hi> of God,<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.6 7.</note> which is the ſigne of his loving kindneſſe, and is that ſpeech of God, by which he doth ſay to our ſoules, he is our ſalvation, and then ariſeth in our hearts peace of conſcience, and joy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>This ſentence of forgiveneſſe unto the conſcience hath diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees: it is ſometimes more cleare in the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſoule, ſomtimes more dimme, yea ſometimes quite
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:593:231"/> blotted out in the counterpane of our releaſe, or copie of our acquittance; as it was with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> Pſal. 51. ſo that a perſon perfectly juſt before God, hath ſometime little or no ſenſe or apprehenſion of it in his owne conſcience, but doubteth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in ſtate of grace or no. Which happeneth becauſe of the ſtaine and guilt of new ſinnes, which guilt abideth in the conſcience, untill a man do confeſſe his ſinnes, repent, and aske forgiveneſſe, and, by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed faith, apply forgivenes: by which meanes the evidence of his pardon is againe by the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> exemplified, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by this new application is againe pronounced in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; whence ariſeth new aſſurance of ſalvation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed joy in the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>This is that juſtification, which for diſtinction ſake, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines</hi> call juſtification by parts,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:593:231"/> or continued, or repeated juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or new application of one and the ſame juſtification: which juſtification though in reſpect of the ſentence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in heaven, is one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall act, whereby a man ſtandeth alwayes juſt before God; yet in reſpect of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of that ſentence to the heart, it is not actually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; neither can a particular ſinne be ſaid to be everie way actually forgiven, untill after it have beene committed, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and repented of; nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till forgiveneſſe be asked, and until the holy Ghoſt hath made new application thereof unto the conſcience, through renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of faith, by which a man doth againe and againe, as new ſinnes are committed, apply the merits of the bloud of Chriſt unto his ſoule. Alſo it muſt be knowne that the ſentence of pardon which is paſſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:593:232"/> with God, is not fully exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted untill the laſt degree of it, when ſentence of abſolution ſhall be pronounced by Chriſt Ieſus: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inherite the kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for you from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world,</hi> Matt. 25.34. It muſt moreover be conceived and held, that notwithſtanding <hi>this diſtinction of juſtification</hi> betweene an <hi>abſolute juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in reſpect of <hi>God,</hi> and a <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification by parts</hi> in reſpect of <hi>application to mans conſcience,</hi> there are not two kindes of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, a firſt and a ſecond, as the Papiſts hold: but one and the ſame juſtification, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in different reſpects. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Gods actuall acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a mans perſon, juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is abſolute; but in reſpect of the actuall application and manifeſtation of Gods accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto a mans conſcience, juſtification is by parts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:593:232"/> When a man alreadie ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified asketh forgiveneſſe, he doth not ask a new juſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a ſecond or new applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pardon unto the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thoſe particular ſinnes which are daily committed, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with continuance of Gods favour, and more cleare evidence that he is ſealed up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the day of redemption.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be ſpoken of for the better underſtanding the word <hi>[forgive]</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the effects following the apprehenſion thereof; theſe are <hi>Peace of conſcience,</hi>

               <p>Theſe things touching juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and remiſſion of ſinnes being opened, we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is prayed for, when we ſay, <hi>Forgive ſinnes.</hi> Wee pray, firſt, that thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto Gods election, but are not yet converted, may be accepted of God through
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:593:233"/> Chriſt Ieſus, God not imputing their ſinnes to them, but unto Chriſt, whereby they are freed from the curſe. We pray like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that Chriſts righteouſnes may be imputed to them, that they beleeving in Chriſt, might bee ſaved; and for that cauſe pray, that they may beleeve. Secondly, wee pray that our ſelves and others being juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and accepted into favour, it would pleaſe the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this his favour, and that he would ſignifie and make the ſame knowne to our hearts and conſciences daily, by a new te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification of the holy Ghoſt, accompanied with a new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of pardon for new ſinnes daily committed, and that wee may have more and more aſſurance of our perfect redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that we may have peace of conſcience, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, in the meane time.</p>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:593:233"/>
               <p>The particular circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this Petition come next to bee laid open, which are three: Firſt, the connexion of this Petition by this copulative <hi>(and)</hi> that is, As well forgive ſinnes, as give daily bread. The ſecond is, the perſon who is to forgive, that is, God the Father, through the ſatisfaction and mediation of the Sonne, by the application of the holy Ghoſt. Thus much is implyed in <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give,</hi> in which the perſon God is underſtood.</p>
               <p>The third circumſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the perſons prayed for, <hi>(us)</hi> that is, the ſame perſons mentioned in the fourth Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, namely, our ſelves, and all our neighbours living upon the earth, that belong to Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, be they alreadie juſtified or not juſtified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As we forgive.</hi> Theſe words containe an argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him that prayeth, to
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:593:234"/> aske forgiveneſſe. The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>for we forgive:</hi> which place in <hi>Luke</hi> doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret this in <hi>Matthew.</hi> The particle <hi>(as)</hi> doth import a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, from an act of ours towards man, of that which we would have God do for us; but it doth not denote either the meaſure or manner how we would have God forgive us, but onely a certaintie of the truth of their owne forgiving of others. And although this <hi>(as),</hi> and <hi>(for)</hi> in <hi>Luke,</hi> ſhew that theſe words are a reaſon and argument to move us to aske and expect forgiveneſſe from God; yet it doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that our forgiving of others is the cauſe why God ſhould forgive us: but arguing from the leſſe to the greater, argueth thus: We do, and can forgive; therefore God can much more forgive us alſo. This is but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of their eſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:593:234"/> unto God, reaſoning from a ſigne of Gods love and grace towards them, that they have cauſe to expect forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. In like manner <hi>(for)</hi> is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Luk. 7.48. <hi>Her ſinnes which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much:</hi> where the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans love was not a cauſe of great forgiveneſſe, but a fruit and ſigne of Gods forgiveneſſe. So that in theſe words he that prayeth, doth repreſent to his owne thoughts, and doth utter unto God thus much: That ſith he himſelf that hath but a drop of mercie, yet could and did forgive; and ſith this power in them to forgive others, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a reflexe of his mercy towards them, and ſo was an argument that he already loved them; therefore they are bold to aske and expect forgiveneſſe of him, who is infinite in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and hath begun to ſhew mercie to them alreadie.</p>
               <pb n="436" facs="tcp:593:235"/>
               <p>The ſenſe of this whole Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition may be rendred thus: <hi>O Lord God, who art the onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver of ſinnes, ſith we cannot glorifie thy Name, neither can our lives be pleaſing to thee, or comfortable to our ſelves, ſo long as thou art unreconciled to us, and ſo long as thou hideſt thy lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving countenance from us: bee pleaſed therfore through Chriſt, whom thou haſt made to be our redemption, to be reconciled to me, and to all thine elect upon the earth: impute not our ſinnes to us, but free and acquit us from the whole guilt and puniſhment of all ſinnes, ſmall and great. For this cauſe we confeſſe our ſinnes, and do beleeve thy promiſe of forgiveneſſe, Lord helpe our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.

If they have offended, and are in danger of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the lawes of man, then, if by petition, or bribe, ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or by any other meanes they can procure either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations, releaſements, or pardons, they will ſpare no paines this way: Or if they can make ſure to themſelves, and to theirs, large temporall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, it is all that they doe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make ſure in this life: but they are altogether negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:593:239"/> in ſeeking remiſſion of ſinnes by Chriſt Ieſus, they have no thoughts of making their calling and election ſure. Nay, becauſe they would be thought to have reaſon for what they doe, in not ſeeking for aſſurance of ſalvation, they would make themſelves and others beleeve, that it is impoſſible to be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that to be ſure of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is high preſumption. If they can provide for their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they will truſt <hi>God</hi> with their ſoules, they hope that he that made them will ſave them: they confeſſe they bee ſinners, and who are not? Thus ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they paſſe over their <hi>Iuſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> a matter of the greateſt conſequence of any thing that can concerne them. But what doth this argue, but that they are ignorant &amp; ſenſleſſe of their miſeries: for if they knew they were caſt and condemned, they would, as in caſe of life and

But let them not catch hold and reſt on theſe preſumptuous hopes, they will deceive them, for they be but the hypocrites hopes, like ſpiders webs; the Beeſome of death putteth an end to them all.

And though we be ſaved by that purchaſe of Chriſt, how were we ordained thereto? How was Chriſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and became a purchaſer for us?

               <p>Had man ſtood in equall tearmes with God, when he entred into covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with him; and the tenour of the covenant had beene that he muſt keepe the Law, or be damned, except he himſelfe could procure a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſuertie to ſuffer, and be damned for him. If man had then procured for himſelf ſuch a ſuertie, and the ſame ſuertie had made ſatisfaction; in this caſe, Gods aquitting the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had beene a meere act of juſtice. But <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood bound alone, without a ſuertie, and, he having ſinned; both the new covenant, and the ſuertie in whom it was eſtabliſhed, and
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:593:244"/> all the meanes, whereby a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is ſaved are of Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appointment, accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and acceptance; he glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying himſelfe by ſaving ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man in a way as well of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercie, as of infinite ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.

So that free grace in God, and ſuch a purchaſed redemption by God for man, can ſtand well together. Indeed our ſalvation in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for he hath paid deare for it. Therefore when hee doth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate for us to his Father, hee can, and doth hold forth his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and ſatisfaction for us; that his Father may ſee that now the Law is ſatisfied, he may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                  </label> there are two things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre: Firſt, defect of love in him that wrongeth us, which is apt to beget the like defect in us, to cauſe us to ceaſe to love him, yea to ſpite and ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. The ſecond thing is, there is ſome hurt or damage groweth either to our name, life, or goods, which worketh in us that are wronged, deſire of ſatisfaction, and recompence for the hurt done unto us. The firſt of theſe, namely, their ill
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:593:267"/> will to us, muſt alwayes be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given; ſo that all ill will in us to them, and all purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge muſt abſolutely and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be laid downe by us: and of this forgiveneſſe the petition ſpeaketh: of requiring of debts and of ſatisfaction for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond evill in the wrong done to us, that is, for the hurt and damage wee ſuſtained by the wrong, is that which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alloweth us to require. Yet becauſe requiring of debts and ſatisfactions may proceed from malice and revenge, difference muſt bee put betweene one wrong and another: ſome are ſmall, and they do us little da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and the conſequence of them cannot bee to any great harme: ſome other wrongs are great, which do much hurt our names, goods, or lives, and the conſequent of them is great.</p>
               <p>Againe, ſatisfactions muſt be diſtinguiſhed: ſome are to be
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:593:267"/> made to the Magiſtrate, others unto the partie wronged.</p>
               <p>Now all thoſe ſmaller wrongs, which are no great blemiſh to our name, or any great empairing of our goods or quiet, muſt be remitted, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in reſpect of ſatisfaction;<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Temptation is good, or evill.</p>
               <p>A good and blameleſſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, when any one that hath right to make experiment of what a man is, or of what he will do, doth (to a right and good end, by lawfull meanes) make triall whether a man will do or not do that to which he is
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:593:272"/> moved or occaſioned.</p>
               <p>An evill and blame-worthy temptation is, when the end of him that tempteth is, that hee that is tryed or tempted ſhould do that which is evill; doing it with a mind to perſwade there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leade,</hi> By this act of Gods <hi>leading into temptation,</hi> we are to underſtand ſuch an over-ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling act of Gods providence, by which he diſpoſeth of all things good and evill, whereby, (part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by what he doth by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with him that temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, touching the <hi>ſubſtance of his act,</hi> and partly by what hee permitteth in not hindring what he could hinder concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>the evill and irregularitie thereof,</hi> and partly by what he omitteth, leaving a man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſtrugle and wraſtle with the temptation) it commeth to paſſe that a man is not onely intiſed unto, but overcome of

               <p>God muſt be acknowledged to have an holy hand in all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations whether good or evill.</p>
               <p>In good temptations God is properly an agent and worker,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.1.2.</note> as when he <hi>proved and tempted Abraham by commanding him to offer his onely ſonne Iſaac:</hi> likewiſe <hi>when he cauſeth men to proſper,</hi> as when he <hi>rained Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na to tempt or proove</hi> the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Exod. 16.4</note> whether they would walke in his law; In like manner <hi>when he ſendeth afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as he did to the Iſraelites in the wildernes to humble them, <hi>and to prove what was in their hearts,</hi>

               <p>Now becauſe where God permitteth tempters to tempt, and alſo forbeareth to give grace to reſiſt the temptation, he doth not remove that, which, if it were removed, would hinder the temptation, nor give that which ſhould hinder the yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, and for that hereupon ſuch is mans ſinful diſpoſition) temptation, and ſinning follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth infallibly, therefore this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and omiſſion of Gods, is expreſſed by words of action, and by words (as it were) of eauſality as here, by <hi>leading;</hi> though God be farre, and farre from being any cauſe of the ſinne, or of being any blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy cauſe of the temptation,

                  <hi>To tempt</hi> unto ſinne proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (which God doth not) and to <hi>leade onely into temptation,</hi> (which God doth, and may do) doe much differ. For to tempt, (taken in the evill ſenſe) is to intice, &amp; to indeavour to move the will of man to wickedneſſe, and that with a minde to have him to act it: according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Iames,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1.14.</note> 
                  <hi>A man is tempted when he is drawne away by his luſt, and is inticed.</hi> Of this tempting it is which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, when hee ſaith to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi>

               </p>

                  <pb n="517" facs="tcp:593:275"/> (taken in the good ſenſe) as it proceedeth from God, is onely ſuch an act, or acts of Gods ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty and wiſe providence concerning man, whereby it ſo commeth to paſſe, that a man is expoſed to the temptations ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Sathan, of other men, or of a mans owne euill luſts, who are the proper, and onely actors of temptation unto ſinne.</p>
               <p>In this act of <hi>leading into temptation,</hi> alluſion may in part be made unto the acts of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of an Army, who may according to his diſcretion, lead which band he pleaſeth, and ſet them in the <hi>Forlorne hope,</hi> the place of greateſt danger; and may keepe which band he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth in the <hi>Reſerve,</hi> or in ſome Fort, the place of greateſt ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

<pb n="526" facs="tcp:593:283"/> from him a will to take part, with a tentation to evill, ſo that his former unwillingnes to good, &amp; his former willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to evill ceaſeth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee hath no longer a will actually to reſiſt that which is good, though in reſpect of the nature of the will, there doth remaine a poſſibility of reſiſting, if the will were otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p>The will of man which was ill diſpoſed, having formerly loſt its freedome to good, being in bondage to ſinne and to Sathan, is now by this grace of GOD rightly diſpoſed, being freed and ſet at liberty to bend it ſelf, from ſinne; towards holineſſe, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This alteration and change in the will of man, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall determination of it by Gods grace infuſed, is not made
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:593:283"/> by any conſtraint of the will, for the will cannot be conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; And it is without any the leaſt infringing of the liberty of mans will in a moſt free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of his acts. For it is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a gentle, by a ſweet, and by a gratious drawing forth the act of the will, in a morall way, by force of argument and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. For it cauſeth (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the propounding) that divine truths are received with that cleareneſſe and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in mans judgement, that in reaſon hee neither can, nor will chuſe but beleeve them.

Let it now be conſidered, if <hi>Adam</hi> in ſtate of innocency, and in a ſtate of perfection, if when he was left to the liberty and power of his will, the temptation cauſed his will, that was in equall balance, to will and to make choiſe of that which was evill; being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome of the temptation, is it poſſible that any man living, (who ſhall have onely grace to will and do well, <hi>if he will,</hi> who ſhall have no more grace of God, till firſt he himſelfe hath determined to will that which is good) ſhal ever actually with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand daily temptations, or, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fallen, ſhall ever riſe out of his fall; for hee never will <hi>will,</hi> either to reſiſt the temptation, or by repentance to riſe out of his ſinne.</p>

His decree, His ſupport of the actors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance of his power to the ſubſtance of the act of ſinne, His permiſſion, His propoſing of external objects, His forbearing to give his ſanctifying Spirit, His withdrawing his common gifts of his Spirit, whereby the

               <p>Now touching the counſell and decree of God to permit ſinne, and then for to leave man hardened in his ſinne, and laſt of all, to puniſh him eternally for ſinne, no man hath cauſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept againſt any thing herein: whether we reſpect Gods ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative acts in not willing to hinder ſinne, but to permit it; as alſo in his not giving grace to ſome men to riſe out of it; or whether wee reſpect his affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative acts thereabouts, as his concurrence to the ſubſtance of the act, or his determination of the meanes whcreby ſin ſhould be committed, and of the ends to which ſinne ſhould ſerue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſhould bee committed.</p>
               <pb n="580" facs="tcp:593:311"/>
               <p>Which I will make to appeare thus, as followeth.</p>
               <p>God intending to glorifie himſelfe in the manifeſtation of his manifold excellencies in the attributes of his goodnes, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, power, mercie, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he decreed, and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with himſelf to create man, and to make him good, even after his owne image; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to give him power to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in that goodneſſe if hee would: Moreover hee decreed to leave him to himſelfe, even to the liberty of his will, and to permit him to fall into ſinne; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing withall to raiſe ſome of mankinde out of their fall and ſinfull condition, through Chriſt, by giving them faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and grace to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in the way of holineſſe, and in the end to give them everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life, notwithſtanding that by ſinne they had deſerved e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting death, and that for
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:593:311"/> the manifeſtation of his glory in the way of mercie mixed with remunerative juſtice: like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hee together decreed, to leave the other ſome of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde fallen into ſinne, and not to vouchſafe them the grace of faith and repentance; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all hee decreed, that for their ſinne hee would puniſh them with eternall death, and this for the manifeſtation of his glory in the way of juſtice vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>This I conceive to be but one formall decree of meanes (not ſubordinate one to another, but ordained together) tending to one maine end, namely, to the end of all ends, even to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, though in different wayes, to wit, in the way of mercy, &amp; in the way of juſtice, namely,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.22.23.</note> to the <hi>making knowne of the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy which he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared to glory:</hi> and alſo
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:593:312"/> 
                  <hi>to the ſhewing of his wrath, and making of his power knowne on the veſſels of wrath, fitted, or made up to deſtruction.</hi> For <hi>God made</hi> (therefore it muſt needs be that he decreed to make) <hi>all things for himſelfe:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 16.4.</note> not onely the godly, who are the veſſels of his mercy, for the day of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but alſo <hi>the wicked, who are the veſſels of his wrath, for the day of evill, even for the day of deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God decreed that ſin ſhould be by his permiſſion, through <hi>Adams</hi> fall. God did not leave it to be as a fortuitous, or caſuall thing which perhaps might come to paſſe, &amp; perhaps might not come to paſſe; but fore-ſaw it, as a thing certaine, that ſinne would bee, through <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion of his Law, in as much as he determined to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Vpon this permiſſion it did infallibly follow that <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="583" facs="tcp:593:312"/> would ſinne. For this permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being granted, the thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted muſt needs follow; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods will can neither be changed, nor reſiſted. And without Gods will nothing can be. The event alſo, and mans woful experience, doth too wel prove that ſin is in the world.</p>
               <p>God likewiſe decreed to leave ſome men in ſtate of ſin, not giving them of his ſaving grace, and alſo determined for ſinne to condemne them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth clearely by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, that <hi>ſome ſtumbled at Chriſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone,</hi> and at the Word,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.8.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſobedient, <hi>whereunto alſo they were appointed;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.9.</note> And hee ſaith alſo, that God knoweth how to reſerve the unjuſt unto the day of judgement to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are not ordained to wrath,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.9.</note> implying that God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſome, namely, the wicked,
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:593:313"/> unto wrath. Saint <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith of certaine men <hi>that were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to this condemnation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iude 4, &amp; 13.</note> to wit, to bee left to their owne hearts luſts, turning the grace of God into wantonneſſe; and, alſo, for that their wickedneſſe, to have <hi>the blackneſſe of darkneſſe</hi> reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for them.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee what it is which God hath decreed touching ſinne. Now leſt God ſhould have any the leaſt imputation of unjuſtice or cruelty caſt upon him, or of being the author of ſinne; which were blaſphemous to conceive. I will therefore in the ſecond place ſhew how, and in what manner hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed ſinne to be, and to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; whereby it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that God is holy, and blameleſſe, even in this as well as in all other his wayes; and will bee every way juſtified when he is judged.</p>
               <p>It is moſt true that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:593:313"/> that ſixe ſhould bee; but how? He did not decree that ſinne ſhould be, as he decreed that all good things ſhould be, namely, by his operation, hee producing them; but he decreed that ſinne ſhould be onely by his permiſſion. It muſt alſo be conſidered, how ſinne came to have a being by Gods permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Permiſſion, either is a midle thing betweene command and prohibition, and in that ſenſe it imports a kinde of allowance; in this ſenſe God never did, nor will permit ſinne; for he hath moſt ſtraightly forbid i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; or elſe permiſſion is taken for a middle thing betweene furthering the being of a thing, and impediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or hindering of the being of the ſaid thing, in this ſenſe it is taken in Gods decree of ſinne; he willed it to be, but ſo as he did not further the being of it as it is ſinne, nor yet did he hinder the being of it, onely hee did
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:593:314"/> permit it.</p>
               <p>Great difference muſt be put berweene Gods decreeing the things that be good, and the things that be morally evill. For the decree that good things ſhall be, is accompanied alwaies with an effectuall operation of God, which cauſeth them to be; but the decree that evill ſhall be by Gods permiſſion is not accompanied with any effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all furtherance or operation of God in the way of a cauſe to effect it. God is truly the cauſe of every thing that is good; but he is not at all truly the efficient cauſe of the evill of ſinne: yet there was good cauſe why God might decree to permit man for to ſinne. For he knew it could be no wrong done to the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, if he ſhould leave him to his owne nature to do according to the nature and freedome of his will; eſpecially, he having made it onely diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:593:314"/> to good, and able to hold it ſelfe onely to that which was good, if he would. Beſides, he knew that to leave the creature (made in ſuch perfection) to its owne nature, was in it ſelfe, not againſt, but according to the common good of the creature. Wherfore ſith God knew how ſinne might be, without his cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it to be, and knew alſo that, for the manifeſtation of his further glory, it did belong to his omnipotent wiſedome and goodneſſe rather to draw good out of evill, then not to permit it; why might not he in his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſedome decree to permit it?</p>
               <p>Moreover, there could be no faultineſſe in ſuch a decree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in it was ſet ſuch an order, that neither the coming of things to paſſe by Gods per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, nor that which ſhould come to paſſe by his working, ſhould either offer violence to
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:593:315"/> the wills of the reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or ſhould take away the liberty or contingency of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes; but doth eſtabliſh them rather. For Gods decree doth determine the creature to worke according to its nature, that as all naturall agents (as that ſtones ſhould deſcend, if they be not upheld, and that fire ſhould burne combuſtible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſhould worke neceſſarily; ſo all voluntary agents ſhould worke freely and contingently. The liberty of the creature, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſinfulneſſe of the act of the creature may and doth well ſtand with the decree of God.</p>
               <p>Indeed upon ſuppoſition of Gods decree to permit <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, it followed by neceſſarie conſequent that <hi>Adam</hi> would fall; yet was it not neceſſarie that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily: But rather upon ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods decree, <hi>Adams</hi>
                  <pb n="589" facs="tcp:593:315"/> fall, by eating the forbidden fruit which God permitted him to do, came to paſſe freely and contingently, that is, with a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of the contrary, namely, of forbearing to eate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit. This was becauſe God had made man a rationall and voluntary agent, to worke contingently, and freely, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the freedome of his will; and not to be forced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by any neceſſity. The decree of permitting ſinne doth not lay any neceſſity upon any man to commit ſinne. Sinne hath not relation to Gods decree as the effect hath to its cauſe, but onely as a conſequent of it, and as an object whereabout the decree is converſant.</p>
               <p>Gods fore-knowledge of what ſhall come to paſſe, and his will to permit it to come to paſſe are ſufficient to denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a neceſſity, or certaintie of event, that the ſame thing muſt
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:593:316"/> needs come to paſſe: but neither his fore-knowledge, or his will that a thing ſhall come to paſſe by his permiſſion, maketh God the author of that which is fore-knowne, or permitted: but, to produce a thing, that maketh God to be the author of it. As for ſinne, there is no operation of God concerning it as it is ſinne, but rather negation, or ſuſpenſion of that grace which if God did beſtow, would keep man from committing of it. Gods decree to permit ſinne, doth not deſtinate any man to ſinne, for deſtination is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining of a perſon to a certaine end: an evill action cannot be the end to which a man is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. And this decree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſinne, and of leaving him in his ſinne, and then of damming him for ſin, all which preſuppoſe that God decreed to create man, yet from hence it doth not follow that God
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:593:316"/> made any man to the end hee might damne him: the end of his creation, and of all the parts of Cods decree, was the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his owne glory. <hi>He made all things for himſelfe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 16:4.</note> Now if man might fall by Gods permiſſion, and yet God is free from being author of ſinne: then who can have any colour of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, if after man is fallen, God do leave him in his ſinne, and ſhall condemne him for his ſin, eſpecially, ſith that, though Gods decree to leave a man in ſtate of ſinne, and to reprobate him from faith, and other graces needfull to ſalvation be abſolute and without any cauſe out of God, but of his meere will and abſolute pleaſure: yet he never decreed to reprobate or deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate any to damnation abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, nor yet doth he execute or damne any but for his ſinne. God never doth ſave, or damne any abſolutely: but as they are
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:593:317"/> found to be in Chriſt, or as they are found, to be in their ſinnes, out of Chriſt. For God did not abſolutely elect any unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor abſolutely reject any to damnation; but he decreed to ſave only thoſe which ſhould actually, by his Spirit, beleeve in Chriſt, repent, and perſevere in an holy life to the end; if they be of yeares of diſcretion, and ſuch as by ſecret union of the Spirit ſhould by a way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to us, partake of, and belong to Chriſt, if Infants within the covenant of grace. And he decreed to damne onely ſuch as ſhould perſevere in their ſinne, and infidelity. For the promiſe of ſalvation, and the threat of damnation is made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively onely to ſuch. Yet know that God, of his meere will and pleaſure, did abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elect ſome, and did determine to give them the grace of faith in Chriſt, repentance towards
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:593:317"/> God, and perſeverance in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life; and likewiſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to reject others there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and to leave them in their ſinne, and infidelity.</p>
               <p>Thus God is cleared from being any author of ſinne, or, yet, to blame, if he proceed in rigour in the eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome for ſinne.</p>
               <p>I will laſt of all ſhew that God was no deficient cauſe in <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne, though he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to permit it, and did work accordingly, either by denying his grace, or by concurring with him to the ſubſtance of the act which was ſinfull. In all this God did not carry himſelfe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than an abſolute Lord, and a moſt holy God might rightfully do.</p>
               <p>What though God made the forbidden fruit of an alluring nature, pleaſant to the eye, and good for food, as it ſeemed to <hi>Eve;</hi> and was called by an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:593:318"/> name, a <hi>Tree of knowledge of Good and evill?</hi> What though God expoſed <hi>Eve</hi> unto the temptation of the Serpent, and <hi>Adam</hi> to the temptation of his wife? What if God reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the good Angels that they did not, as otherwiſe they might, aſſiſt <hi>Adam</hi> againſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and againſt his temptation, by minding him of his duty to God, and of the falſhood and malice of the devill, and how much he was but lately behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to God? And what though God left <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to themſelves, without giving the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> actuall aſſiſtance of his grace, any more than what he gave them in their creation, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from falling, which he gave to the good Angels and denyed to others? What hath God done in all this which he might not do?</p>
               <p>For notwithſtanding all this, there was a naturall and true
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:593:318"/> poſſibility in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to have forborne to eate of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit in ſpite of Satan though hee did his utmoſt that he could. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did eate the forbidden fruit as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without compulſion, as ever before they had eaten of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tree in the Garden: No compulſion, but bodily appetite leading them to eate of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon fruit; and partly bodily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and partly affectation of being like God in knowing good and evill, ſeducing them to eate the fruit which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</p>
               <p>There remained (I ſay) a true poſſibility in <hi>Adam,</hi> to have ſtood. For, by vertue of the graee of God received in the creation, he could not only have abſtained from every outward action forbidden him of God, but to abſtaine from it in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manner, for that both out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and inwardly hee was
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:593:319"/> more diſpoſed, and better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to obedience, then to diſobedience, being made of an holy diſpoſition within, and having the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, yea an eaſie commandment given to <hi>Adam</hi> for his greateſt good, and that from that God who had newly made him after his owne likeneſſe, and had made all the world for him. Wherein now was God wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in any thing towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> which hee ought to have done for him?</p>
               <p>Man now being fallen (not through any fault in God, for <hi>God made him good, but they ſought out many inventions,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 7.29.</note> (which cauſed their fall) that God ſhould elect whom he will in Chriſt to give them grace, and according to their grace to give them eternall glory; and on the other ſide, that God ſhall reprobate others, whom he will,
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:593:319"/> and leave them in their ſinnes, and for their ſinnes to puniſh them with eternall death, who can juſtly complaine or except againſt it. If any man cannot fully comprehend theſe things, and ſatisfie his owne reaſon herein, yet he is to beleeve that it is ſo. For this is an object of our faith, rather then of diſpute how it can be. It is ſufficient that the Scriptures ſay it is ſo. That ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>O man</hi> (that art a man of a ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low reach and apprehenſion, that art a creature, and now art a ſinfull creature) <hi>who art thou that replieſt againſt God?

This ſhould ſatisfie every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in this point. Secondly, that God by an act of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and power upholdeth the tempters and tempted, giving

God hee is a cauſe concurring to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the act; he concurreth not to the ſinfulneſſe of the act, but onely denieth his grace, which if he would have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to beſtow, it would have hindered it: which grace hee is not bound to give to any: It was enough that hee gave a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grace to <hi>Adam</hi> to ſtand, if hee would.

               <p>The fourth thing to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered is, the end which God propoſeth and attaineth by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and ordering of the ſinnes of men, far different from thoſe which men propoſe in
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:593:323"/> committing of them: which ends are holy &amp; good, namely, to ſet forth his owne glory; and that many wayes, as by diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the impotency of the creature, what need it hath to depend upon the creator, for that man though perfect, yet could not ſtand for want of a ſpeciall grace to ſupport him: alſo to manifeſt his owne free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and abſoluteneſſe over his creature; beſides that, his wiſdome ſaw that permitting ſinne (in ſuch a way as could no way impeach his holineſſe) it would make way for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of his power in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite grace and mercy mixed with juſtice towards ſome, and in his infinite juſtice towards others.

               <p>Why might not God firſt permit ſinne to be in the world, that ſo a cleere way might bee made to the manifeſtation of his holineſſe in hatred of ſinne, and in his juſt revenge upon ſinners? in which reſpect though ſinne was no way good in acting, yet it was good that it ſhould be acted. And ſince the fall, his end of giving up the wicked unto abhominable ſins, is to ſhew his diſpleaſure, in his righteous puniſhing of one ſinne with another; for this hee holdeth to bee a meet and equall puniſhment; as he ſaith of the Romans,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17.</note>

<pb n="608" facs="tcp:593:325"/> and worketh that humiliation, repentance, and care to ſhunne ſinne afterwards, which would not elſe have beene wrought in them. Seeing therefore God hath ſuch good ends moving him to permit ſinne, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it in manner as hath been ſaid, he is to be cleared from all imputation of faulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all that he hath to do in the ſinnes of men.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is how God ſtandeth affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto ſinne.

<pb n="651" facs="tcp:593:346"/> every motion unto the doing of any thing which God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in his word; or to the leaving undone any thing that God hath commanded; or to do any thing otherwiſe then God hath commanded. When a thought of any evill is preſented to the minde to be done, this is a temptation.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The tempters are, Satan, called the <hi>tempter,</hi> Matth. 4.3.<note place="margin">Iam. 2:14.</note> and men, with whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, when they move others to ſinne; and alſo the luſts of our owne evill hearts.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Theſe tempters doe move a man to ſinne, by preſenting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the minde, thoughts of ſinne to be committed by him. The divell by his ſuggeſtions, as hee did to <hi>David,</hi> putting him in minde to number the people.<note place="margin">1 Chro 2.21.1.</note> Man tempteth by ſpeech, or ſome outward ſigne, whereby he giveth a man to thinke what evill hee would have him doe.
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:593:347"/> Thus the harlot tempteth by her words,<note place="margin">Prov. 7.</note> by her eye-lids, and by her dalliance. A man tempteth himſelfe, when the luſt of his owne evill heart doth miniſter matter of thoughts of ſin to be committed, or when by the ſenſe of ſome outward object, the evill heart taketh occaſion to preſent evill thoughts unto the minde. Sometimes all theſe tempters conſpire together in one and the ſame temptation, and moſt commonly Satan and the evill heart combine in thoſe temptations which are moſt miſchievous. But wee need not ſo much inquire who tempteth, as to know how to reſiſt the temptation.</p>
               <p>Theſe tempters proſecute their temptation in this ſort. If the partie tempted be of himſelf a ſlave to ſinne, and is given o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto ſinne, and is already diſpoſed to a particular ſinne, then there needeth no more but
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:593:347"/> a bare ſuggeſtion or motion to it; that is enough to cauſe ſuch a one to commit it. But if a man be indued with the Spirit of grace, or of reſtraint, then all the devices that the wit of man and ſubtiltie of the divell can finde out, ſhall be uſed, both in the propoſing of the temptation, and proſecuting thereof. Then an eye ſhall be had to all aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that may be taken, either from a mans naturall diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or from his ſexe, or from his different condition of life and calling; from his eſtate in the world, be he rich or poore, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or baſe; or from his eſtate in grace, bee hee a babe or ſtrong man in Chriſt; or from obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in what thing a man is leaſt armed; or from obſervation what a man doth eſteeme or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteeme moſt; alſo from place, time, ſolitarineſſe, company; &amp;, whatſoever particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhall fall out, it ſhall be
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:593:348"/> taken to the greateſt advantage to further the temptation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of the infinite varieties of evill unto which, and of the manifold varieties of meanes by which a man may bee tempted. In moving a man to like that which is evill, there is alwayes a face and appearance of good ſet upon it: and in moving a man to diſlike that which is good, a vizard of evill is put upon it: or if notwithſtanding the motion, the evill to which a man is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, will appeare ſinfull, then they will preſent conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it is but once, or for a ſhort time that they ſhall hold that evill courſe; alſo, how the beſt men have fallen, and have notwithſtanding beene ſaved: how that God is mercifull, &amp;c. And withall, motives ſhall bee fetcht from the credit, profit, or pleaſure, that ſhall be attained upon yeelding: and on the other ſide, from diſgrace, loſſe or pain
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:593:348"/> that may follow upon not yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the temptation. It is not in the power of man to finde out the windings and turnings, the ſleights and devices, the cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning reaſonings and ſubtilties that ſinne by its agents can and doth uſe to circumvent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnare mankinde. Sinfull inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are ſo deepe, that moſt wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> profeſſeth he could not find them out, no not in either ſexe: for ſo he ſaith, <hi>The inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſinfull devices of one man of a thouſand, have J found out; but the inventions or ſinfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices</hi> (for thus the ſupply of the defective ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tence is to be made) <hi>of one woman among all thoſe have I not found.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now that it appeareth what a temptation is, alſo who are the tempters; and that ſinne by her agents Satan and ſinfull men, is moſt craftie and cunning in tempting, it remaineth that we ſhould chiefly learne how wee may bee preſerved from being inſnared by it.

Wherefore heartie prayer muſt be made to him, as our Saviour teacheth us, that <hi>hee would not leade us into temptation, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from evill.</hi> And becauſe he reſiſteth temptations in us by his Spirit, by putting into us
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:593:349"/> good motions to the contrary; prayer muſt be made unto God, that he would give unto his holy Spirit, which may worke effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually in us againſt temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Whoſoever is good before God, and pleaſeth him, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall take heed that he doe not grieve this Spirit, &amp; quench the good motions of it, they praying for it, ſhall bee ſure to have it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.13. and ſhall eſcape the hurt of the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the ſinner ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by it. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.26. Yet it is not enough that we be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God, and doe keepe our peace with him, and have his holy Spirit dwelling in us: for though God could ſubdue al our ſinnes, and reſiſt all our tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for us, without our owne helpe, yet he will have us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, by exerciſing the whole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man in the conflict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne: for which cauſe he giveth his word to direct us, and

               <p>Now that we may withſtand temptations, it ſhall be good to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> obſerve this order: Firſt <hi>to looke to our owne heart,</hi>

               <p>This is the ſecond part of the Lords Prayer, whereby is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the right diſpoſition of the minde and heart of a man when he prayeth, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very life of prayer. This Hebrew word <hi>Amen,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for the moſt part untranſlated in Greeke, Latin, Engliſh, and in all other lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. It is uſed either in the beginning or ending of a ſpeech. In the beginning of a ſpeech it importeth an earneſt aſſeveration, whereunto our
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:593:378"/> ſaying, <hi>verily,</hi> or <hi>indeed,</hi> or <hi>in very truth,</hi> doth anſwer: in this ſenſe it is often uſed by Chriſt in the Goſpell. When it is in the latter end of a ſpeech, as here, and in divers other places, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth two things, either a wiſh of the heart to obtaine what is propoſed, or elſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the heart that it ſhall obtaine that which was propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Oft times it ſignifieth both. That <hi>Amen</hi> is a wiſh and deſire of what was before ſpoken of, it appeareth by <hi>Benaiah's</hi> anſwer to <hi>David,</hi> when he had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Solomon</hi> to be ruler over Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and over Iudah, ſaying, <hi>Amen,</hi> which he doth explane by theſe words, <hi>The Lord God of my Lord the king ſay ſo too.</hi> 1. King. 1.36. That <hi>Amen</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a perſwaſion of faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing before ſpoken of, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. where when <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid of Chriſt, that he was over all, God bleſſed for ever, he
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:593:378"/> addeth <hi>Amen,</hi> that is, he was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly perſwaded that it was ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Amen,</hi> in this place, ſignifieth both the aſſent and wiſh of the heart, as alſo aſſurance of faith, and expectation of the petitions before mentioned. Theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent acts of the ſoule, <hi>ſcil.</hi> a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie wiſh, and expectation of what is wiſhed, are not ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, but that they may in one inſtant be acted at once in the heart, and therefore may fitly be expreſſed in one word, ſo long as the word, <hi>Amen,</hi> doth ſignifie both thoſe acts of the ſoule. As it expreſſeth the aſſent and deſire of the heart, it impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth knowledge, truth of heart, and fervor in asking. As it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth faith of the heart, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth an aſſured expectation to obtaine the things asked. This ſenſe of <hi>Amen</hi> may be thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: <hi>O heavenly Father, now that I have asked all theſe peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:593:379"/> according to thy will, in the name of Chriſt, I do heartily wiſh and deſire againe and againe, that thou wouldeſt grant them: and I am perſwaded, and do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that in the beſt time they ſhall be granted.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>1</label> divinity, which requireth no more in prayer then a generall good intention of the heart, which is ſufficient, though it be not underſtood what is asked, and though a particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the minde be not added (and I would it were onely the Papiſts errour.)

               <p>Fourthly, God may for good cauſes oft-times deferre the granting of your requeſts, which muſt not be accounted for a deniall.</p>
               <p>If the fault be in your ſelfe, either through the faultineſſe of your perſon, or action in prayer; then God of purpoſe forbeareth to grant your prayer, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he heareth not, but becauſe he would have you to amend what was amiſſe both in your ſelfe, and in your prayer.</p>
               <p>To qualifie a mans perſon that hee may have his prayer heard, it is requiſite (1.) that
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:593:386"/> he be the true childe of God, that he be ingrafted into Chriſt by faith, and that hee abide in Chriſt, and have his word dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in him. For, <hi>Abide in me,</hi>

(3.) He that would himſelfe be heard of God, and have God to forgive him, muſt be one that hath put on bowels of mercie,<note place="margin">Col 3.13.

(5.) He that would obtaine his petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt be readie preſt, and be induſtrious in uſing thoſe means wherein, and whereby the good thing asked is by Gods providence, or grace uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed; elſe, let no man looke to have his prayer granted. He that doth aske daily bread, he muſt labour, and uſe the lawfull ordinarie meanes of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, elſe he may juſtly ſtarve, notwithſtanding his prayer. So likewiſe a man may pray for knowledge, for faith, repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and for eternall life; but if this bee but a ſluggards wiſh, and be not joyned with uſing the ordinarie meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="733" facs="tcp:593:387"/> faith, and repentance; as namely, hearing, reading, and meditating of the Word of God, and a right partaking of the Sacraments. If a man do not heed the Word, if he do not conſider it, and lay it to his heart: If he do not withall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſtrength which hee hath gotten in the uſe of the meanes of grace, conſidering what grounds, and what cauſe he hath to beleeve and repent, &amp;c. and if he do not aſſay, and put himſelfe on to the leaving the ſinne he prayeth againſt, or to the doing whereof he deſired grace of God; let him never thinke that he ſhall obtaine the things prayed for. For God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended to give them, but in the uſe of thoſe means which he hath preſcribed.</p>
               <p>If therefore your perſon bee not thus qualified: If either you be not in ſtate of grace; or if you live in any groſſe ſinne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented;
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:593:388"/> or if you bee not in charity with your neighbour; or if you have beene and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull for old favours; or if you be failing in not uſing the lawfull meanes of having what you aske, you may thanke your ſelfe if (though you have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) yet you have not your peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Though your perſon may be in the maine fitly qualified in the former reſpects, yet there may be ſuch failing in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act of praying; that it may hinder the granting of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: As (1.) If you pray not to God onely. (2.) If you conceive not of God aright. (3.) If you pray not in the name of Chriſt, at leaſt impliedly. (4.) If the matter of your prayer bee not good and warrantable. (5.) If you do not pray with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. (6.) If you do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your prayer as a worſhip of God, and be ſincere in it. (7.)
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:593:388"/> If it be not with a ſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. (8.) If it bee not with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of minde. (9.) If it be not with fervour. (10.) If it be not with holy devotion. (11.) If it be not to a right and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable end. (12.) And if it be not in faith, beleeving that you ſhall have your requeſt put up to God in manner as aforeſaid; and if it bee not ſuch a faith which cauſeth you to waite pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently; then, if God have not heard, you muſt blame your ſelf; and if you would be heard ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, conſider wherein you failed, and amend it; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culary take heed that when you have endeavoured to pray as well as you can, that, your not beleeving you ſhould be heard, be not the chiefe cauſe why you have not your prayers gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>It will further be objected, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>
                  </label> If the before-mentioned fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings may hinder the granting
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:593:389"/> of our prayers; then who can beleeve that ever his prayer ſhall be heard; for who faileth not in ſome or other of them.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt God is many times better to us than our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and if hee pleaſe, hee may grant our petitions though made with ſome ſpeciall fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; if he do, it is of his mercy; if he do not, the fault was in us. But ſecondly, difference muſt be put betweene a failing, out of weakneſſe and manifold temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and that which is through wilfulneſſe, and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary negligence. If a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience can witneſſe to himſelfe, that, when he prayeth, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and the bent of his heart is to pray aright, and not to faile; then God for Chriſts ſake, in whoſe name prayer is made, doth paſſe by and forgive ſuch failings, and doth certainely heare. Wherefore, in ſuch caſes, we ought, when we pray, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:593:389"/> that God will grant our prayers, notwithſtanding ſuch failings in prayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though we have not offended him in our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet God may ſee cauſe why he will not grant them. For the generall rule of his promiſe to heare our prayers doth admit of ſome exception. As, firſt when, if the thing asked were granted, it would croſſe ſome acts of his eternall purpoſe, not knowne to us, which he hath intended for the ſetting forth of his glory in wayes unknowne to us; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in things concerning his Church, or our owne ſelves in particular. Moreover, we are apt to deſire things to come to paſſe in ſuch or ſuch a way, and by ſuch or ſuch meanes, and in ſuch or ſuch a manner, as we thinke may ſtand well with Gods will; when yet God hath ſome other way, ſome other meanes of doing his Church or
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:593:390"/> of doing us good, in another manner then we expect. Many times wee would have it our way; but God holdeth it beſt to give it his way.<note place="margin">2 King. 5.11.</note> Like <hi>Naaman</hi> the leper, he would be cured one way; but God cured him by another way.<note place="margin">Act. 27.24.30.44.</note> God ſaved <hi>Paul</hi> and all with him, not as they would by the ſafety of the ſhip; but by the pieces of the ſhip af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhipwracke. We are apt to reſt upon ſuch and ſuch meanes, and to ſet the meanes above God; then it is fit that he ſhould chooſe other meanes, yea hee doth many times chooſe weake meanes to confound the ſtrong, that all the praiſe may be given to God, and that no fleſh might glory in his preſence. Many want comfort, and other things becauſe they preſcribe to God the meanes.<note place="margin">Mat. 26.39.</note> 
                  <hi>In ſuch caſes</hi> wee ſhould alwayes pray with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, namely, if thou wilt let this thing be, or let this thing
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:593:390"/> paſſe, yet not my will, but thine be done.</p>
               <p>A ſecond exception is, if the thing asked be not for our good. We many times aske for things good in themſelves, and lawfull for us to aske; but God who knoweth what is better for us than we do, he knoweth that if we had them, they would not be good for us. In this caſe to be denyed our ſuite is a mercy, and and a favour to us. God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that we ſhall want nothing that is <hi>good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 34.10. Pſa. 84.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Rom. 8.28.</note> and that hee will with-hold nothing that is <hi>good;</hi> and that all things ſhall worke together for <hi>good</hi> to them that love him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, God doth heare and grant our prayers when wee thinke that he doth not. God doth grant our requeſts divers wayes,</p>
               <p>Sometimes he giveth the ſame thing that is asked even in the ſame kinde: as when God
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:593:391"/> gave unto <hi>Hannah</hi> a ſonne at her requeſt:<note place="margin">1 Sa. 1.27.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 21.2.</note> and gave unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his hearts deſire.</p>
               <p>Sometimes God doth not give the ſame thing in kinde which is asked; but the ſame in effect, or that which is farre better. When wee aske tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bleſſings, as health, wealth, liberty, or the removall of ſuch and ſuch a croſſe, it may be God doth not hold it fit that thoſe particulars ſhould bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but if inſtead thereof hee ſhall pleaſe to give patience and contentedneſſe; and more and more acquaintance with God, and a greater dependance on him: If God ſhall give ſtrength and grace ſufficient to beare the croſſe, and to want the thing deſired; if God by the want of earthly things teach us to eſteeme of and to ſeeke after the true health, riches, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſoule. If hereby we bee weaned from this preſent
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:593:391"/> world, and bee more renewed in our mindes, and can bee brought to have our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more in heaven, than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe wee ſhould have had if our particular prayer had been granted, who can ſay that God hath not heard him? who will not ſay, but that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him more than his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts?</p>
               <p>Moreover God doth give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his children their requeſts in the ſame kind when they think he doth not; for many thinke that if they have not humility, patience, power to reſiſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and to pray with life and fervour as they would, and if they feele not that they have faith according to that meaſure which they deſire: or if they have not the like meaſure of faith, and of the gift of prayer and of other graces which they conceive to be in other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, they conclude they have
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:593:392"/> none at all; whereas God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at their requeſt given theſe to them in truth, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, hee hath heard their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and hath granted their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. God never intendeth to give to all men one and the ſame meaſure of his ſaving gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but as hee in the parable gave to ſome more, and to ſome leſſe, ſo doth hee in diſpenſing of his grace. If wee have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe graces in truth, as we have certainely, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to deſire them, and do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to grow in them. Wee ſhould bee now thankfull for what we have, and ready to be glad and more thankfull, if wee could have more; and wee ſholud bee carefull to improve what wee have to the utmoſt. But we muſt not repine againſt God for that we have ſo little; nor yet envy others for that they have ſo much; nor yet ſlander Gods gifts by ſaying
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:593:392"/> hee hath not heard us, or given us ſuch and ſuch graces, becauſe hee hath not given us ſo much grace, as hee hath given to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or ſo much as wee have deſired that hee ſhould give to our ſelves. This fault muſt be amended, elſe know, that wee deſerve that God ſhould be ſo farre from giving us more, that in his juſtice, he may take away from us, even that which wee have. The leaſt meaſure of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace which hee giveth to any of his children, the graine of muſtard ſeed, and that which is called a <hi>little ſtrength,</hi> this deſerveth to be acknowledged, and to be cheriſhed, and, untill wee can get more, wee ſhould walke, and worke, and fight in the ſtrenth thereof: for this <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſtrength,</hi> if wee put it forth,<note place="margin">Revel. 3.8.</note> will enable us to keepe Gods word, and will keep us that we ſhall not deny Chriſts name. This ſmall meaſure of grace
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:593:393"/> will uphold us in ſtate of grace, and by the ſupport of the word of Gods grace, it will <hi>build us up,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20.32</note> 
                  <hi>and bring us to heaven,</hi> even to an inheritance among them that are ſanctified.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God doth often defer the granting of our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; this muſt not be accounted a deniall.</p>
               <p>God deferreth to give the thing asked many times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee are not ſufficiently humbled,<note place="margin">Iudg. 20.18.23.26.</note> or otherwiſe fitted for audience.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he deferreth the thing petitioned, for the triall and exerciſe of our faith, and patience,<note place="margin">Mat. 15.22 unto verſe 28.</note> and hope: for this cauſe hee deferred the woman of Canaan.</p>
               <p>Sometimes hee doth it to quicken our deſires, and to make us the more importunate with him.</p>
               <p>Sometimes hee deferreth us that we may be drawne to ſeek
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:593:393"/> him againe and againe; hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to ſee the faces of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren often, which hee ſhould not do if we might ſpeed at the firſt asking.</p>
               <p>Laſtly hee ſometimes defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to give the thing asked, to the end that we might the more eſteeme the thing asked, after that it is granted; and may bee the more thankfull for it. For ſuch is our corruption and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that what is lightly come by, is lightly ſet by; and what is eaſily gotten, is quickly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten: But what we get with many prayers and teares, and with much wraſtling, wee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it the more pretious in it ſelfe; and wee acknowledge our ſelves the more beholden to him that giveth it.</p>
               <p>Now therefore to conclude this point, let none ſay, how can I beleeve that God heareth mee, when yet I finde that I have not the thing asked? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:593:394"/> what hath laſt been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I will only adde this: If you have not yet that needfull good thing which you have prayed for, yet ſtill you muſt continue to pray for it: For, know that Gods promiſe of hearing and granting is not made to this or that particular prayer, but to a conſtant courſe of asking.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>2</label> Wherefore it doth concern all that pray, to pray in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and in an aſſured expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of the things they pray for. When in the truth of your ſoule you have aſſayed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to poure out your ſoule to God in prayer, though with much infirmity, yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put up in the name of
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:593:394"/> Chriſt, to be heard for his ſake, be ſure that you adde this, that you doe <hi>beleeve that you are heard,</hi> and beleeve that in the beſt time, and in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, your petition ſhall bee granted: beleeve this, that you ſhall have what you asked, or which is much better, which you ſhould rather have asked.</p>
               <p>There is a neceſſity of faith in prayer, without which wee cannot hope to ſpeed; I meane not onely, that faith by which wee beleeve that God is,<note place="margin">Heb. 11 6.</note> and that hee is a diligent rewarder of them that ſeeke him, and whereby we do beleeve in him to ſalvation,<note place="margin">Mar. 11.24</note> but that faith whereby we beleeve that wee ſhall receive in particular the things which in prayer we doe deſire of him. Faith in prayer is ſo neceſſary, that Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man lack wiſdome,</hi> (the ſame may bee ſaid of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things) <hi>let him aske of
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:593:395"/> God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 5 6.7</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>let him aske in faith;</hi> if he do not, let not that man (ſaith hee) thinke that hee ſhall receive any thing of the Lord. If we beleeve, we <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 3.33.</note> and ſet to our <hi>ſeale that God is true</hi> in his promiſe; but if we beleeve not,<note place="margin">1 Io. 5.10.</note> we make him a liar; and do much diſhonour his holy name.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe, that a mans faith and expectation may, and muſt differ in degrees, it muſt bee more or leſſe, according as the things prayed for, are abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, or not neceſſary; and according as Gods promiſe, the ground of our faith, and hope, is abſolute, or conditionall. Our prayer for things needfull, bee they things ſpirituall, or temporall, muſt be particular and abſolute becauſe a generall petition, namely, that God ſhould doe with us as hee pleaſeth, as may bee for his glory, and for our
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:593:395"/> good, is properly no petition: for in ſaying ſo, a man asketh no certaine thing, neither doth hee know what he doth aske: So likewiſe a conditionall peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no petition. Wee may and muſt truly and particularly deſire the things lawfully ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: yet as wee aske temporall things with leſſe earneſtneſſe and intenſion of minde, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things with more fervor and intenſion of minde; ſo our expectation of the one is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and more firme; our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the other is leſſe firme, and alwayes with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion (either expreſſed or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood) unto the will of God.</p>
               <p>In reſolving this Caſe,<note place="margin">2 Caſes whether a man may aske temporall things ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.</note> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man may aske temporall things abſolutely, I will with it, propound and anſwer another Caſe, to wit, Whether when a man hath asked temporall things, he may expect them ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely.<note place="margin">Whether when a man hath asked tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall things he may abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them.</note>
               </p>
               <pb n="750" facs="tcp:593:396"/>
               <p>I anſwer, difference muſt be put between asking a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and expecting a thing abſolutely, when it is asked. There are ſome things may bee asked abſolutely, which yet may not abſolutely bee expected; Gods command is the ground of our asking; this command to pray for temporall things, is abſolute, for we are as well bid to aske our daily bread, as to aske forgiveneſſe of ſins. Gods promiſes are the ground of our faith and expectation of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the things asked. Now all Gods promiſes are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; his promiſe of temporall things, and of ſuch ſpirituall things as are not neceſſary to ſalvation, doth admit of reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and exceptions: that is, hee will give temporall things to us, ſo farre as they may well ſtand with our enjoying of thoſe good thing which are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and eternall. Likewiſe
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:593:396"/> his promiſes which concerne the giving a ſpecialty of grace, and of comfort, over and above what is neceſſary to ſalvation, upon our asking, are to bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with this exception, unleſſe, hee holdeth it beſt,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.8.9.</note> to keepe us humble, hungry and thirſty, watchfull and prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, under the ſenſe of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, and want of what we deſire; which in ſome caſes is farre better for us, than to have our deſire. Namely, when if we had ſuch or ſuch grace and comfort, we ſhould bee exalted above meaſure, and ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe them that had not the like, or ſhould grow preſumptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecure.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when wee ſhall aske for ſpirituall things abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary for Gods glory and mans good, ſuch as hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods name, comming of his kingdome, and doing of his will, alſo forgiveneſſe of ſinnes,
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:593:397"/> and grace to convert, repent, and to live godly: theſe things being asked in the truth of our heart, we muſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> unto them with a full and abſolute aſſurance that our petitions are granted; for of theſe things the promiſes are abſolute.</p>
               <p>But as for petitions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our outward man, &amp; ſtate of life, and concerning ſuch and ſuch degrees, and meaſure of grace, and concerning the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of comfort, in the aſſurance of our forgiveneſſe, all which are lawfull and needfull to bee prayed for; though we muſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to theſe alſo with true aſſurance that God heareth, and is well pleaſed with thoſe our Petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; yet we muſt not ſay <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> with that abſolute expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of enjoying the things ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For theſe are asked with a reſervation ſtill unto Gods will, both when he ſhall pleaſe, and in what meaſure he ſhall in his
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:593:397"/> gracious pleaſure thinke good. For my part therefore, upon the former grounds, I conceive, that though temporall good things, as health, libertie, peace, life, and the like, may be abſolutely ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is diſtinctly, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly without condition; yet thoſe things ſo asked are not abſolutely to be expected, in the very particulars, to be granted. Onely this we may and muſt abſolutely expect, when wee pray even for theſe things, that either we ſhall have them, or that which is better, at leaſt that we ſhall have <hi>grace ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> to ſuſtaine us without them,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 12.9</note> ſo as to have matter of comfort in God in this life, and of hope of ſalvation in the life to come. For in that we have prayed in faith, this ſhould ſtay our hearts.</p>
               <p>That we may attaine this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, our care muſt be that we make and keepe our peace with God, and that we do get
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:593:398"/> and cheriſh the ſpirit of prayer,<note place="margin">Luk. 11.13.</note> that we may alwayes pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his will in the name of Chriſt Ieſus,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.13.14.</note> then we may build upon his promiſe, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his almightie power and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, and we may confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay with Saint <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.14.15.</note> that <hi>we know that God heareth us, and that we have the petitions that we deſired of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, to conclude this point, ſuppoſe that when you have done what you can in prayer, yet you do not feele nor finde that you have a comfortable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to your prayers; yet be not diſcouraged, nor give over, as your troubled heart, and your malicious adverſary will oft ſuggeſt unto you; but pray dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and, ſith you have a promiſe of audience, beleeve and hope, even above your feeling, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove hope. For it will not be in vaine that you ſtill pray. Prayer is a dutie to God, now if you
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:593:398"/> pray, though for the preſent you have no other benefit, but this, the diſcharge of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in obedience to God, this will give ſome ſecret ſupport to the ſoule; But bee you aſſured,<note place="margin">Gal. 6 9.</note> as in all other well-doing, ſo you ſhall finde in this, be not weary, and in due ſeaſon, you ſhall reape if you faint not, and give not over.</p>
               <p>Thus I have with Gods aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance finiſhed this Treatiſe upon the Lords Prayer: in which, amongſt many other things, we may ſee the neceſſity of prayer, the excellency of it, and alſo how to pray. I will adde a word or two touching the difficultie of praying aright.</p>
               <p>This doctrine of the <hi>difficul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie of praying aright,</hi> I gather partly from the need that <hi>Chriſts owne diſciples</hi> had to be taughe to pray:<note place="margin">Luk. 11.1.</note> and partly by the many things required in prayer, of which you have heard
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:593:399"/> before. And for proofe hereof conſider that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth of himſelfe and other beleevers,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26</note> ſaying, <hi>We know not what we ſhould pray as we ought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The cauſes of the difficultie are many.</p>

Thus <hi>David</hi> ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his faith in prayer, ſaying, Be mercifull to me, O Lord, for I crie unto thee daily;<note place="margin">Pſal. 86.3.5</note>

               <p>Theſe may and muſt looke into the evidences of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, and ſonne-ſhip. They muſt conſider whether they do not beleeve in Chriſt by ſuch a faith which worketh by love, (but they muſt not ſay they have not this faith, when their conſcience can tell them that it is their deſire that it may work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by love, and that it is their griefe when they faile in their duties of love to God or man) now if they by faith have intereſt in Chriſt, then they may know they are the ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe </seg>3</label> pray aright; then, is it thus with any man or woman, that in prayer they have found that their hearts have beene enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, their ſpirits raiſed up, their thoughts gathered in, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, their mindes intentive, and attentive, their faith ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, and their conſcience ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon this their heartie and devout powring out their ſoule unto God: O then let them bleſſe God for it; for by his grace they have done a great and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult worke: they have done a bleſſed and moſt happie worke. It is our great faults that we can onely complaine of our defects in prayer, and not alſo take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice

We have a preſident for the uſing of means after prayer, and that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods direction, in the example of a good Captaine, <hi>Cornelius:</hi> hee had faſted and prayed, and (as wee may judge by Gods anſwer) hee prayed to be informed in the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: God directed him to the ordinary meanes; and he moſt diligently applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:593:404"/> unto them, as we may read <hi>Acts</hi> the 10.5.9. and all with moſt happy ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ſhall bee good for us after wee have prayed, from time to time to looke after our prayers, and carefully to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve how they are anſwered, and how God hath granted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; whether in the ſame parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, or ſome other way, either in giving us better things, or giving patience and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without them, or quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us ſtill to prayer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on him, cauſing as quietly to wait on him, till he ſhall pleaſe to beſtow them; and accordingly wee muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods goodneſſe to us with thankfulneſſe, as <hi>David</hi> did,<note place="margin">Pſal. 86.18.19.</note> ſaying, <hi>Verily God hath heard mee, hee hath attended in the voyce of my prayer. Bleſſed bee God which, which hath in turned away my prayer, not in mercy from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="767" facs="tcp:593:404"/>
               <p>If upon obſervation we do not find our petitions granted, then we muſt conſider wherein wee fayled in prayer, and amend it; but we muſt not bee diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor ſuffer our ſoules to bee too much diſquieted: we muſt pray againe, and wait,<note place="margin">Pſ. 42.11.</note> as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did, on God, aſſuring our ſelves that in his good time hee will heare us, and that we ſhall praiſe him, who is the health of our countenance, and our God; to whom be praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
